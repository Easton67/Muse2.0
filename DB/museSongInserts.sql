You walkin'' round naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over
When it''s all over, no settlin'' down
My text go to your screen, you know better than that

I''m sittin'' at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinkin'' that this song''s comin'' on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start callin''; you start crying
I come over; I''m inside you
I can''t find you, the girl that I once had
But the %!$ that we have isn''t half bad

That''s code for "He''s not here"
And I''ma flirt with this new girl
And I''ma call if it don''t work

Hmm, well, two can play that game
So I''m chillin'' with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing, and wrong girls come runnin''
I''m paranoid that these girls want somethin'' from me
And it''s hard to make a dime go one-hunnid
And my dude freakin'' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
''Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin'' ''em if she''d wanna play games

I miss the %!$ where you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?

Only thing girls want when you in that smoke and light

I''m here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place
All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feeling about that
So God bless you
And I hope I''ll see you109Embed', 1, N'None', 0, 100001, NULL, 100000, NULL, N'2024-03-20 00:00:00')

Oh, that I can hardly stand

No, youâ€™re not the only

Donâ€™t wanna be slowing
Maybe I should be going
Since we hang on by a thread

[Chorus]
In doubt
Nothingâ€™s in my sleeve
No it isnâ€™t over now
Makes me feel naÃ¯ve
Better not be the one who falls in love again
Donâ€™t want to make-believe now

[Verse 2]
I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a given
So here we are wishing
We can live with our contrast
Itâ€™s not the only
No itâ€™s not the only
Reason I could ever add
Maybe I could be growing
Instead of always holding
Half my life in doubtfulness

Long way down from the heights I''m chasin''
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas

Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin'' off my phone for the night now, baby

I got reserved space in this game, not ''cause my verse great

But this !#@!# the worst case of a dirt-stain absurd gay blade tryna claim game since the third day of high school, dude been scared straight
And it''s not ''cause he was on the wrong path, out class skipping
Not a outcast pitching contraband clout for stash dealings
He got caught without a hall pass, hour of detention
He saw the Lord''s call and got devout ''bout religion
Now this proud Christian mention pow-pow bidness
If I don''t drown out his sentence, I''ma roundhouse kick him
I keep telling myself he just a loudmouth bitching
But I''m a mild schizophrenic that ran out of my prescription
Now, I get to flipping, twitching out animalistic
Go wild up on a mission, prowling ''bout to get him
Forget about the crowd, you win shrouds, cloud his vision
And hop out like a lion when it''s pouncing on a victim
I''m gouging out his eyes, rip his nostrils off, sniff ''em
Reach in his mouth, snatch his tongue out, smile and then kick it
Start howling at the ceiling with a coyote resemblance
Jump down look around, start growling at the women
Foul malicious violence what you now about to witness
The scene gon'' look like a crime that a crocodile committed
911, start dialing up the digits
Humane Society and SWAT team gotta surround every entrance
It sound very vicious, but I lack a sane half a brain I actually may grab a blade and amputate ya'' hands and face I have a shank
Stab a place, burst your wound, gaps and space
Through ya'' body tissue, you now resemble a basket crate
I''m a basket case, needing some help please
I keep hearing bells ring and people that yell screams
These voices in my head, and the things that they tell me
Got me scheming evil things like when demons in hell think
Like, creep where he dwell put the heat where he smell
Keep him still while fingering his girl like reading in Braille

I took damage no bandage, happy to go hurt !#@!#
I got here, only God I fear

Now it''s to the point the %#!@ ain''t fun
Y''all all know RemyD spit sharp, I got a switchblade tongue
You couldn''t beat me if you was Jay-Z''s son with Kanye''s drums had Drake''s mixtape buzz and all of Lil Wayne drugs

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula went on in an unreal suspense, the last weeks before going away. She was not herself,â€”she was not anything. She was something that is going to beâ€”soonâ€”soonâ€”very soon. But as yet, she was only imminent.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She went to see her parents. It was a rather stiff, sad meeting, more like a verification of separateness than a reunion. But they were all vague and indefinite with one another, stiffened in the fate that moved them apart.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She did not really come to until she was on the ship crossing from Dover to Ostend. Dimly she had come down to London with Birkin, London had been a vagueness, so had the train-journey to Dover. It was all like a sleep.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And now, at last, as she stood in the stern of the ship, in a pitch-dark, rather blowy night, feeling the motion of the sea, and watching the small, rather desolate little lights that twinkled on the shores of England, as on the shores of nowhere, watched them sinking smaller and smaller on the profound and living darkness, she felt her soul stirring to awake from its anaesthetic sleep.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Let us go forward, shall we?'' said Birkin. He wanted to be at the tip of their projection. So they left off looking at the faint sparks that glimmered out of nowhere, in the far distance, called England, and turned their faces to the unfathomed night in front.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They went right to the bows of the softly plunging vessel. In the complete obscurity, Birkin found a comparatively sheltered nook, where a great rope was coiled up. It was quite near the very point of the ship, near the black, unpierced space ahead. There they sat down, folded together, folded round with the same rug, creeping in nearer and ever nearer to one another, till it seemed they had crept right into each other, and become one substance. It was very cold, and the darkness was palpable.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â One of the ship''s crew came along the deck, dark as the darkness, not really visible. They then made out the faintest pallor of his face. He felt their presence, and stopped, unsureâ€”then bent forward. When his face was near them, he saw the faint pallor of their faces. Then he withdrew like a phantom. And they watched him without making any sound.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They seemed to fall away into the profound darkness. There was no sky, no earth, only one unbroken darkness, into which, with a soft, sleeping motion, they seemed to fall like one closed seed of life falling through dark, fathomless space.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They had forgotten where they were, forgotten all that was and all that had been, conscious only in their heart, and there conscious only of this pure trajectory through the surpassing darkness. The ship''s prow cleaved on, with a faint noise of cleavage, into the complete night, without knowing, without seeing, only surging on.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In Ursula the sense of the unrealised world ahead triumphed over everything. In the midst of this profound darkness, there seemed to glow on her heart the effulgence of a paradise unknown and unrealised. Her heart was full of the most wonderful light, golden like honey of darkness, sweet like the warmth of day, a light which was not shed on the world, only on the unknown paradise towards which she was going, a sweetness of habitation, a delight of living quite unknown, but hers infallibly. In her transport she lifted her face suddenly to him, and he touched it with his lips. So cold, so fresh, so sea-clear her face was, it was like kissing a flower that grows near the surf.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But he did not know the ecstasy of bliss in fore-knowledge that she knew. To him, the wonder of this transit was overwhelming. He was falling through a gulf of infinite darkness, like a meteorite plunging across the chasm between the worlds. The world was torn in two, and he was plunging like an unlit star through the ineffable rift. What was beyond was not yet for him. He was overcome by the trajectory.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In a trance he lay enfolding Ursula round about. His face was against her fine, fragile hair, he breathed its fragrance with the sea and the profound night. And his soul was at peace; yielded, as he fell into the unknown. This was the first time that an utter and absolute peace had entered his heart, now, in this final transit out of life.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â When there came some stir on the deck, they roused. They stood up. How stiff and cramped they were, in the night-time! And yet the paradisal glow on her heart, and the unutterable peace of darkness in his, this was the all-in-all.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They stood up and looked ahead. Low lights were seen down the darkness. This was the world again. It was not the bliss of her heart, nor the peace of his. It was the superficial unreal world of fact. Yet not quite the old world. For the peace and the bliss in their hearts was enduring.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Strange, and desolate above all things, like disembarking from the Styx into the desolated underworld, was this landing at night. There was the raw, half-lighted, covered-in vastness of the dark place, boarded and hollow underfoot, with only desolation everywhere. Ursula had caught sight of the big, pallid, mystic letters ''OSTEND,'' standing in the darkness. Everybody was hurrying with a blind, insect-like intentness through the dark grey air, porters were calling in un-English English, then trotting with heavy bags, their colourless blouses looking ghostly as they disappeared; Ursula stood at a long, low, zinc-covered barrier, along with hundreds of other spectral people, and all the way down the vast, raw darkness was this low stretch of open bags and spectral people, whilst, on the other side of the barrier, pallid officials in peaked caps and moustaches were turning the underclothing in the bags, then scrawling a chalk-mark.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It was done. Birkin snapped the hand bags, off they went, the porter coming behind. They were through a great doorway, and in the open night againâ€”ah, a railway platform! Voices were still calling in inhuman agitation through the dark-grey air, spectres were running along the darkness between the train.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Kolnâ€”Berlinâ€”'' Ursula made out on the boards hung on the high train on one side.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Here we are,'' said Birkin. And on her side she saw: ''Elsassâ€”Lothringenâ€”Luxembourg, Metzâ€”Basle.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''That was it, Basle!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The porter came up.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''A Baleâ€”deuxieme classe?â€”Voila!'' And he clambered into the high train. They followed. The compartments were already some of them taken. But many were dim and empty. The luggage was stowed, the porter was tipped.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Nous avons encoreâ€”?'' said Birkin, looking at his watch and at the porter.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Encore une demi-heure.'' With which, in his blue blouse, he disappeared. He was ugly and insolent.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Come,'' said Birkin. ''It is cold. Let us eat.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There was a coffee-wagon on the platform. They drank hot, watery coffee, and ate the long rolls, split, with ham between, which were such a wide bite that it almost dislocated Ursula''s jaw; and they walked beside the high trains. It was all so strange, so extremely desolate, like the underworld, grey, grey, dirt grey, desolate, forlorn, nowhereâ€”grey, dreary nowhere.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â At last they were moving through the night. In the darkness Ursula made out the flat fields, the wet flat dreary darkness of the Continent. They pulled up surprisingly soonâ€”Bruges! Then on through the level darkness, with glimpses of sleeping farms and thin poplar trees and deserted high-roads. She sat dismayed, hand in hand with Birkin. He pale, immobile like a REVENANT himself, looked sometimes out of the window, sometimes closed his eyes. Then his eyes opened again, dark as the darkness outside.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A flash of a few lights on the darknessâ€”Ghent station! A few more spectres moving outside on the platformâ€”then the bellâ€”then motion again through the level darkness. Ursula saw a man with a lantern come out of a farm by the railway, and cross to the dark farm-buildings. She thought of the Marsh, the old, intimate farm-life at Cossethay. My God, how far was she projected from her childhood, how far was she still to go! In one life-time one travelled through aeons. The great chasm of memory from her childhood in the intimate country surroundings of Cossethay and the Marsh Farmâ€”she remembered the servant Tilly, who used to give her bread and butter sprinkled with brown sugar, in the old living-room where the grandfather clock had two pink roses in a basket painted above the figures on the faceâ€”and now when she was travelling into the unknown with Birkin, an utter strangerâ€”was so great, that it seemed she had no identity, that the child she had been, playing in Cossethay churchyard, was a little creature of history, not really herself.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They were at Brusselsâ€”half an hour for breakfast. They got down. On the great station clock it said six o''clock. They had coffee and rolls and honey in the vast desert refreshment room, so dreary, always so dreary, dirty, so spacious, such desolation of space. But she washed her face and hands in hot water, and combed her hairâ€”that was a blessing.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Soon they were in the train again and moving on. The greyness of dawn began. There were several people in the compartment, large florid Belgian business-men with long brown beards, talking incessantly in an ugly French she was too tired to follow.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It seemed the train ran by degrees out of the darkness into a faint light, then beat after beat into the day. Ah, how weary it was! Faintly, the trees showed, like shadows. Then a house, white, had a curious distinctness. How was it? Then she saw a villageâ€”there were always houses passing.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This was an old world she was still journeying through, winter-heavy and dreary. There was plough-land and pasture, and copses of bare trees, copses of bushes, and homesteads naked and work-bare. No new earth had come to pass.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She looked at Birkin''s face. It was white and still and eternal, too eternal. She linked her fingers imploringly in his, under the cover of her rug. His fingers responded, his eyes looked back at her. How dark, like a night, his eyes were, like another world beyond! Oh, if he were the world as well, if only the world were he! If only he could call a world into being, that should be their own world!

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Belgians left, the train ran on, through Luxembourg, through Alsace-Lorraine, through Metz. But she was blind, she could see no more. Her soul did not look out.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They came at last to Basle, to the hotel. It was all a drifting trance, from which she never came to. They went out in the morning, before the train departed. She saw the street, the river, she stood on the bridge. But it all meant nothing. She remembered some shopsâ€”one full of pictures, one with orange velvet and ermine. But what did these signify?â€”nothing.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She was not at ease till they were in the train again. Then she was relieved. So long as they were moving onwards, she was satisfied. They came to Zurich, then, before very long, ran under the mountains, that were deep in snow. At last she was drawing near. This was the other world now.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Innsbruck was wonderful, deep in snow, and evening. They drove in an open sledge over the snow: the train had been so hot and stifling. And the hotel, with the golden light glowing under the porch, seemed like a home.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They laughed with pleasure when they were in the hall. The place seemed full and busy.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you know if Mr and Mrs Crichâ€”Englishâ€”from Paris, have arrived?'' Birkin asked in German.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The porter reflected a moment, and was just going to answer, when Ursula caught sight of Gudrun sauntering down the stairs, wearing her dark glossy coat, with grey fur.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Gudrun! Gudrun!'' she called, waving up the well of the staircase. ''Shu-hu!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun looked over the rail, and immediately lost her sauntering, diffident air. Her eyes flashed.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Reallyâ€”Ursula!'' she cried. And she began to move downstairs as Ursula ran up. They met at a turn and kissed with laughter and exclamations inarticulate and stirring.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But!'' cried Gudrun, mortified. ''We thought it was TOMORROW you were coming! I wanted to come to the station.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No, we''ve come today!'' cried Ursula. ''Isn''t it lovely here!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Adorable!'' said Gudrun. ''Gerald''s just gone out to get something. Ursula, aren''t you FEARFULLY tired?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No, not so very. But I look a filthy sight, don''t I!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No, you don''t. You look almost perfectly fresh. I like that fur cap IMMENSELY!'' She glanced over Ursula, who wore a big soft coat with a collar of deep, soft, blond fur, and a soft blond cap of fur.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And you!'' cried Ursula. ''What do you think YOU look like!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun assumed an unconcerned, expressionless face.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you like it?'' she said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It''s VERY fine!'' cried Ursula, perhaps with a touch of satire.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Go upâ€”or come down,'' said Birkin. For there the sisters stood, Gudrun with her hand on Ursula''s arm, on the turn of the stairs half way to the first landing, blocking the way and affording full entertainment to the whole of the hall below, from the door porter to the plump Jew in black clothes.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The two young women slowly mounted, followed by Birkin and the waiter.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''First floor?'' asked Gudrun, looking back over her shoulder.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Second Madamâ€”the lift!'' the waiter replied. And he darted to the elevator to forestall the two women. But they ignored him, as, chattering without heed, they set to mount the second flight. Rather chagrined, the waiter followed.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It was curious, the delight of the sisters in each other, at this meeting. It was as if they met in exile, and united their solitary forces against all the world. Birkin looked on with some mistrust and wonder.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â When they had bathed and changed, Gerald came in. He looked shining like the sun on frost.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Go with Gerald and smoke,'' said Ursula to Birkin. ''Gudrun and I want to talk.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Then the sisters sat in Gudrun''s bedroom, and talked clothes, and experiences. Gudrun told Ursula the experience of the Birkin letter in the cafe. Ursula was shocked and frightened.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Where is the letter?'' she asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I kept it,'' said Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You''ll give it me, won''t you?'' she said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But Gudrun was silent for some moments, before she replied:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you really want it, Ursula?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I want to read it,'' said Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Certainly,'' said Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Even now, she could not admit, to Ursula, that she wanted to keep it, as a memento, or a symbol. But Ursula knew, and was not pleased. So the subject was switched off.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What did you do in Paris?'' asked Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh,'' said Gudrun laconicallyâ€”''the usual things. We had a FINE party one night in Fanny Bath''s studio.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Did you? And you and Gerald were there! Who else? Tell me about it.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Well,'' said Gudrun. ''There''s nothing particular to tell. You know Fanny is FRIGHTFULLY in love with that painter, Billy Macfarlane. He was thereâ€”so Fanny spared nothing, she spent VERY freely. It was really remarkable! Of course, everybody got fearfully drunkâ€”but in an interesting way, not like that filthy London crowd. The fact is these were all people that matter, which makes all the difference. There was a Roumanian, a fine chap. He got completely drunk, and climbed to the top of a high studio ladder, and gave the most marvellous addressâ€”really, Ursula, it was wonderful! He began in Frenchâ€”La vie, c''est une affaire d''ames imperialesâ€”in a most beautiful voiceâ€”he was a fine-looking chapâ€”but he had got into Roumanian before he had finished, and not a soul understood. But Donald Gilchrist was worked to a frenzy. He dashed his glass to the ground, and declared, by God, he was glad he had been born, by God, it was a miracle to be alive. And do you know, Ursula, so it wasâ€”'' Gudrun laughed rather hollowly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But how was Gerald among them all?'' asked Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Gerald! Oh, my word, he came out like a dandelion in the sun! HE''S a whole saturnalia in himself, once he is roused. I shouldn''t like to say whose waist his arm did not go round. Really, Ursula, he seems to reap the women like a harvest. There wasn''t one that would have resisted him. It was too amazing! Can you understand it?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula reflected, and a dancing light came into her eyes.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' she said. ''I can. He is such a whole-hogger.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Whole-hogger! I should think so!'' exclaimed Gudrun. ''But it is true, Ursula, every woman in the room was ready to surrender to him. Chanticleer isn''t in itâ€”even Fanny Bath, who is GENUINELY in love with Billy Macfarlane! I never was more amazed in my life! And you know, afterwardsâ€”I felt I was a whole ROOMFUL of women. I was no more myself to him, than I was Queen Victoria. I was a whole roomful of women at once. It was most astounding! But my eye, I''d caught a Sultan that timeâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun''s eyes were flashing, her cheek was hot, she looked strange, exotic, satiric. Ursula was fascinated at onceâ€”and yet uneasy.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They had to get ready for dinner. Gudrun came down in a daring gown of vivid green silk and tissue of gold, with green velvet bodice and a strange black-and-white band round her hair. She was really brilliantly beautiful and everybody noticed her. Gerald was in that full-blooded, gleaming state when he was most handsome. Birkin watched them with quick, laughing, half-sinister eyes, Ursula quite lost her head. There seemed a spell, almost a blinding spell, cast round their table, as if they were lighted up more strongly than the rest of the dining-room.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Don''t you love to be in this place?'' cried Gudrun. ''Isn''t the snow wonderful! Do you notice how it exalts everything? It is simply marvellous. One really does feel LIBERMENSCHLICHâ€”more than human.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''One does,'' cried Ursula. ''But isn''t that partly the being out of England?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, of course,'' cried Gudrun. ''One could never feel like this in England, for the simple reason that the damper is NEVER lifted off one, there. It is quite impossible really to let go, in England, of that I am assured.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And she turned again to the food she was eating. She was fluttering with vivid intensity.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It''s quite true,'' said Gerald, ''it never is quite the same in England. But perhaps we don''t want it to beâ€”perhaps it''s like bringing the light a little too near the powder-magazine, to let go altogether, in England. One is afraid what might happen, if EVERYBODY ELSE let go.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''My God!'' cried Gudrun. ''But wouldn''t it be wonderful, if all England did suddenly go off like a display of fireworks.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It couldn''t,'' said Ursula. ''They are all too damp, the powder is damp in them.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I''m not so sure of that,'' said Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Nor I,'' said Birkin. ''When the English really begin to go off, EN MASSE, it''ll be time to shut your ears and run.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''They never will,'' said Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''We''ll see,'' he replied.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Isn''t it marvellous,'' said Gudrun, ''how thankful one can be, to be out of one''s country. I cannot believe myself, I am so transported, the moment I set foot on a foreign shore. I say to myself "Here steps a new creature into life."''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Don''t be too hard on poor old England,'' said Gerald. ''Though we curse it, we love it really.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To Ursula, there seemed a fund of cynicism in these words.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''We may,'' said Birkin. ''But it''s a damnably uncomfortable love: like a love for an aged parent who suffers horribly from a complication of diseases, for which there is no hope.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun looked at him with dilated dark eyes.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You think there is no hope?'' she asked, in her pertinent fashion.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But Birkin backed away. He would not answer such a question.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Any hope of England''s becoming real? God knows. It''s a great actual unreality now, an aggregation into unreality. It might be real, if there were no Englishmen.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You think the English will have to disappear?'' persisted Gudrun. It was strange, her pointed interest in his answer. It might have been her own fate she was inquiring after. Her dark, dilated eyes rested on Birkin, as if she could conjure the truth of the future out of him, as out of some instrument of divination.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He was pale. Then, reluctantly, he answered:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Wellâ€”what else is in front of them, but disappearance? They''ve got to disappear from their own special brand of Englishness, anyhow.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun watched him as if in a hypnotic state, her eyes wide and fixed on him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But in what way do you mean, disappear?â€”'' she persisted.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, do you mean a change of heart?'' put in Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I don''t mean anything, why should I?'' said Birkin. ''I''m an Englishman, and I''ve paid the price of it. I can''t talk about Englandâ€”I can only speak for myself.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' said Gudrun slowly, ''you love England immensely, IMMENSELY, Rupert.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And leave her,'' he replied.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No, not for good. You''ll come back,'' said Gerald, nodding sagely.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''They say the lice crawl off a dying body,'' said Birkin, with a glare of bitterness. ''So I leave England.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Ah, but you''ll come back,'' said Gudrun, with a sardonic smile.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Tant pis pour moi,'' he replied.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Isn''t he angry with his mother country!'' laughed Gerald, amused.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Ah, a patriot!'' said Gudrun, with something like a sneer.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Birkin refused to answer any more.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun watched him still for a few seconds. Then she turned away. It was finished, her spell of divination in him. She felt already purely cynical. She looked at Gerald. He was wonderful like a piece of radium to her. She felt she could consume herself and know ALL, by means of this fatal, living metal. She smiled to herself at her fancy. And what would she do with herself, when she had destroyed herself? For if spirit, if integral being is destructible, Matter is indestructible.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He was looking bright and abstracted, puzzled, for the moment. She stretched out her beautiful arm, with its fluff of green tulle, and touched his chin with her subtle, artist''s fingers.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What are they then?'' she asked, with a strange, knowing smile.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What?'' he replied, his eyes suddenly dilating with wonder.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Your thoughts.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald looked like a man coming awake.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I think I had none,'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Really!'' she said, with grave laughter in her voice.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And to Birkin it was as if she killed Gerald, with that touch.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Ah but,'' cried Gudrun, ''let us drink to Britanniaâ€”let us drink to Britannia.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It seemed there was wild despair in her voice. Gerald laughed, and filled the glasses.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I think Rupert means,'' he said, ''that NATIONALLY all Englishmen must die, so that they can exist individually andâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Super-nationallyâ€”'' put in Gudrun, with a slight ironic grimace, raising her glass.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The next day, they descended at the tiny railway station of Hohenhausen, at the end of the tiny valley railway. It was snow everywhere, a white, perfect cradle of snow, new and frozen, sweeping up an either side, black crags, and white sweeps of silver towards the blue pale heavens.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As they stepped out on the naked platform, with only snow around and above, Gudrun shrank as if it chilled her heart.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''My God, Jerry,'' she said, turning to Gerald with sudden intimacy, ''you''ve done it now.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She made a faint gesture, indicating the world on either hand.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Look at it!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She seemed afraid to go on. He laughed.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They were in the heart of the mountains. From high above, on either side, swept down the white fold of snow, so that one seemed small and tiny in a valley of pure concrete heaven, all strangely radiant and changeless and silent.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It makes one feel so small and alone,'' said Ursula, turning to Birkin and laying her hand on his arm.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You''re not sorry you''ve come, are you?'' said Gerald to Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She looked doubtful. They went out of the station between banks of snow.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Ah,'' said Gerald, sniffing the air in elation, ''this is perfect. There''s our sledge. We''ll walk a bitâ€”we''ll run up the road.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun, always doubtful, dropped her heavy coat on the sledge, as he did his, and they set off. Suddenly she threw up her head and set off scudding along the road of snow, pulling her cap down over her ears. Her blue, bright dress fluttered in the wind, her thick scarlet stockings were brilliant above the whiteness. Gerald watched her: she seemed to be rushing towards her fate, and leaving him behind. He let her get some distance, then, loosening his limbs, he went after her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Everywhere was deep and silent snow. Great snow-eaves weighed down the broad-roofed Tyrolese houses, that were sunk to the window-sashes in snow. Peasant-women, full-skirted, wearing each a cross-over shawl, and thick snow-boots, turned in the way to look at the soft, determined girl running with such heavy fleetness from the man, who was overtaking her, but not gaining any power over her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They passed the inn with its painted shutters and balcony, a few cottages, half buried in the snow; then the snow-buried silent sawmill by the roofed bridge, which crossed the hidden stream, over which they ran into the very depth of the untouched sheets of snow. It was a silence and a sheer whiteness exhilarating to madness. But the perfect silence was most terrifying, isolating the soul, surrounding the heart with frozen air.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It''s a marvellous place, for all that,'' said Gudrun, looking into his eyes with a strange, meaning look. His soul leapt.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Good,'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A fierce electric energy seemed to flow over all his limbs, his muscles were surcharged, his hands felt hard with strength. They walked along rapidly up the snow-road, that was marked by withered branches of trees stuck in at intervals. He and she were separate, like opposite poles of one fierce energy. But they felt powerful enough to leap over the confines of life into the forbidden places, and back again.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Birkin and Ursula were running along also, over the snow. He had disposed of the luggage, and they had a little start of the sledges. Ursula was excited and happy, but she kept turning suddenly to catch hold of Birkin''s arm, to make sure of him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''This is something I never expected,'' she said. ''It is a different world, here.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They went on into a snow meadow. There they were overtaken by the sledge, that came tinkling through the silence. It was another mile before they came upon Gudrun and Gerald on the steep up-climb, beside the pink, half-buried shrine.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Then they passed into a gulley, where were walls of black rock and a river filled with snow, and a still blue sky above. Through a covered bridge they went, drumming roughly over the boards, crossing the snow-bed once more, then slowly up and up, the horses walking swiftly, the driver cracking his long whip as he walked beside, and calling his strange wild HUE-HUE!, the walls of rock passing slowly by, till they emerged again between slopes and masses of snow. Up and up, gradually they went, through the cold shadow-radiance of the afternoon, silenced by the imminence of the mountains, the luminous, dazing sides of snow that rose above them and fell away beneath.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They came forth at last in a little high table-land of snow, where stood the last peaks of snow like the heart petals of an open rose. In the midst of the last deserted valleys of heaven stood a lonely building with brown wooden walls and white heavy roof, deep and deserted in the waste of snow, like a dream. It stood like a rock that had rolled down from the last steep slopes, a rock that had taken the form of a house, and was now half-buried. It was unbelievable that one could live there uncrushed by all this terrible waste of whiteness and silence and clear, upper, ringing cold.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Yet the sledges ran up in fine style, people came to the door laughing and excited, the floor of the hostel rang hollow, the passage was wet with snow, it was a real, warm interior.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The new-comers tramped up the bare wooden stairs, following the serving woman. Gudrun and Gerald took the first bedroom. In a moment they found themselves alone in a bare, smallish, close-shut room that was all of golden-coloured wood, floor, walls, ceiling, door, all of the same warm gold panelling of oiled pine. There was a window opposite the door, but low down, because the roof sloped. Under the slope of the ceiling were the table with wash-hand bowl and jug, and across, another table with mirror. On either side the door were two beds piled high with an enormous blue-checked overbolster, enormous.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This was allâ€”no cupboard, none of the amenities of life. Here they were shut up together in this cell of golden-coloured wood, with two blue checked beds. They looked at each other and laughed, frightened by this naked nearness of isolation.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A man knocked and came in with the luggage. He was a sturdy fellow with flattish cheek-bones, rather pale, and with coarse fair moustache. Gudrun watched him put down the bags, in silence, then tramp heavily out.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It isn''t too rough, is it?'' Gerald asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The bedroom was not very warm, and she shivered slightly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It is wonderful,'' she equivocated. ''Look at the colour of this panellingâ€”it''s wonderful, like being inside a nut.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He was standing watching her, feeling his short-cut moustache, leaning back slightly and watching her with his keen, undaunted eyes, dominated by the constant passion, that was like a doom upon him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She went and crouched down in front of the window, curious.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, but thisâ€”!'' she cried involuntarily, almost in pain.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In front was a valley shut in under the sky, the last huge slopes of snow and black rock, and at the end, like the navel of the earth, a white-folded wall, and two peaks glimmering in the late light. Straight in front ran the cradle of silent snow, between the great slopes that were fringed with a little roughness of pine-trees, like hair, round the base. But the cradle of snow ran on to the eternal closing-in, where the walls of snow and rock rose impenetrable, and the mountain peaks above were in heaven immediate. This was the centre, the knot, the navel of the world, where the earth belonged to the skies, pure, unapproachable, impassable.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It filled Gudrun with a strange rapture. She crouched in front of the window, clenching her face in her hands, in a sort of trance. At last she had arrived, she had reached her place. Here at last she folded her venture and settled down like a crystal in the navel of snow, and was gone.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald bent above her and was looking out over her shoulder. Already he felt he was alone. She was gone. She was completely gone, and there was icy vapour round his heart. He saw the blind valley, the great cul-de-sac of snow and mountain peaks, under the heaven. And there was no way out. The terrible silence and cold and the glamorous whiteness of the dusk wrapped him round, and she remained crouching before the window, as at a shrine, a shadow.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you like it?'' he asked, in a voice that sounded detached and foreign. At least she might acknowledge he was with her. But she only averted her soft, mute face a little from his gaze. And he knew that there were tears in her eyes, her own tears, tears of her strange religion, that put him to nought.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Quite suddenly, he put his hand under her chin and lifted up her face to him. Her dark blue eyes, in their wetness of tears, dilated as if she was startled in her very soul. They looked at him through their tears in terror and a little horror. His light blue eyes were keen, small-pupilled and unnatural in their vision. Her lips parted, as she breathed with difficulty.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The passion came up in him, stroke after stroke, like the ringing of a bronze bell, so strong and unflawed and indomitable. His knees tightened to bronze as he hung above her soft face, whose lips parted and whose eyes dilated in a strange violation. In the grasp of his hand her chin was unutterably soft and silken. He felt strong as winter, his hands were living metal, invincible and not to be turned aside. His heart rang like a bell clanging inside him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He took her up in his arms. She was soft and inert, motionless. All the while her eyes, in which the tears had not yet dried, were dilated as if in a kind of swoon of fascination and helplessness. He was superhumanly strong, and unflawed, as if invested with supernatural force.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He lifted her close and folded her against him. Her softness, her inert, relaxed weight lay against his own surcharged, bronze-like limbs in a heaviness of desirability that would destroy him, if he were not fulfilled. She moved convulsively, recoiling away from him. His heart went up like a flame of ice, he closed over her like steel. He would destroy her rather than be denied.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But the overweening power of his body was too much for her. She relaxed again, and lay loose and soft, panting in a little delirium. And to him, she was so sweet, she was such bliss of release, that he would have suffered a whole eternity of torture rather than forego one second of this pang of unsurpassable bliss.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''My God,'' he said to her, his face drawn and strange, transfigured, ''what next?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She lay perfectly still, with a still, child-like face and dark eyes, looking at him. She was lost, fallen right away.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I shall always love you,'' he said, looking at her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But she did not hear. She lay, looking at him as at something she could never understand, never: as a child looks at a grown-up person, without hope of understanding, only submitting.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He kissed her, kissed her eyes shut, so that she could not look any more. He wanted something now, some recognition, some sign, some admission. But she only lay silent and child-like and remote, like a child that is overcome and cannot understand, only feels lost. He kissed her again, giving up.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Shall we go down and have coffee and Kuchen?'' he asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The twilight was falling slate-blue at the window. She closed her eyes, closed away the monotonous level of dead wonder, and opened them again to the every-day world.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' she said briefly, regaining her will with a click. She went again to the window. Blue evening had fallen over the cradle of snow and over the great pallid slopes. But in the heaven the peaks of snow were rosy, glistening like transcendent, radiant spikes of blossom in the heavenly upper-world, so lovely and beyond.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun saw all their loveliness, she KNEW how immortally beautiful they were, great pistils of rose-coloured, snow-fed fire in the blue twilight of the heaven. She could SEE it, she knew it, but she was not of it. She was divorced, debarred, a soul shut out.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â With a last look of remorse, she turned away, and was doing her hair. He had unstrapped the luggage, and was waiting, watching her. She knew he was watching her. It made her a little hasty and feverish in her precipitation.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They went downstairs, both with a strange other-world look on their faces, and with a glow in their eyes. They saw Birkin and Ursula sitting at the long table in a corner, waiting for them.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''How good and simple they look together,'' Gudrun thought, jealously. She envied them some spontaneity, a childish sufficiency to which she herself could never approach. They seemed such children to her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Such good Kranzkuchen!'' cried Ursula greedily. ''So good!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Right,'' said Gudrun. ''Can we have Kaffee mit Kranzkuchen?'' she added to the waiter.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And she seated herself on the bench beside Gerald. Birkin, looking at them, felt a pain of tenderness for them.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I think the place is really wonderful, Gerald,'' he said; ''prachtvoll and wunderbar and wunderschon and unbeschreiblich and all the other German adjectives.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald broke into a slight smile.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I like it,'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The tables, of white scrubbed wood, were placed round three sides of the room, as in a Gasthaus. Birkin and Ursula sat with their backs to the wall, which was of oiled wood, and Gerald and Gudrun sat in the corner next them, near to the stove. It was a fairly large place, with a tiny bar, just like a country inn, but quite simple and bare, and all of oiled wood, ceilings and walls and floor, the only furniture being the tables and benches going round three sides, the great green stove, and the bar and the doors on the fourth side. The windows were double, and quite uncurtained. It was early evening.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The coffee cameâ€”hot and goodâ€”and a whole ring of cake.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''A whole Kuchen!'' cried Ursula. ''They give you more than us! I want some of yours.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There were other people in the place, ten altogether, so Birkin had found out: two artists, three students, a man and wife, and a Professor and two daughtersâ€”all Germans. The four English people, being newcomers, sat in their coign of vantage to watch. The Germans peeped in at the door, called a word to the waiter, and went away again. It was not meal-time, so they did not come into this dining-room, but betook themselves, when their boots were changed, to the Reunionsaal.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The English visitors could hear the occasional twanging of a zither, the strumming of a piano, snatches of laughter and shouting and singing, a faint vibration of voices. The whole building being of wood, it seemed to carry every sound, like a drum, but instead of increasing each particular noise, it decreased it, so that the sound of the zither seemed tiny, as if a diminutive zither were playing somewhere, and it seemed the piano must be a small one, like a little spinet.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The host came when the coffee was finished. He was a Tyrolese, broad, rather flat-cheeked, with a pale, pock-marked skin and flourishing moustaches.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Would you like to go to the Reunionsaal to be introduced to the other ladies and gentlemen?'' he asked, bending forward and smiling, showing his large, strong teeth. His blue eyes went quickly from one to the otherâ€”he was not quite sure of his ground with these English people. He was unhappy too because he spoke no English and he was not sure whether to try his French.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Shall we go to the Reunionsaal, and be introduced to the other people?'' repeated Gerald, laughing.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There was a moment''s hesitation.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I suppose we''d betterâ€”better break the ice,'' said Birkin.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The women rose, rather flushed. And the Wirt''s black, beetle-like, broad-shouldered figure went on ignominiously in front, towards the noise. He opened the door and ushered the four strangers into the play-room.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Instantly a silence fell, a slight embarrassment came over the company. The newcomers had a sense of many blond faces looking their way. Then, the host was bowing to a short, energetic-looking man with large moustaches, and saying in a low voice:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Herr Professor, darf ich vorstellen-''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Herr Professor was prompt and energetic. He bowed low to the English people, smiling, and began to be a comrade at once.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Nehmen die Herrschaften teil an unserer Unterhaltung?'' he said, with a vigorous suavity, his voice curling up in the question.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The four English people smiled, lounging with an attentive uneasiness in the middle of the room. Gerald, who was spokesman, said that they would willingly take part in the entertainment. Gudrun and Ursula, laughing, excited, felt the eyes of all the men upon them, and they lifted their heads and looked nowhere, and felt royal.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Professor announced the names of those present, SANS CEREMONIE. There was a bowing to the wrong people and to the right people. Everybody was there, except the man and wife. The two tall, clear-skinned, athletic daughters of the professor, with their plain-cut, dark blue blouses and loden skirts, their rather long, strong necks, their clear blue eyes and carefully banded hair, and their blushes, bowed and stood back; the three students bowed very low, in the humble hope of making an impression of extreme good-breeding; then there was a thin, dark-skinned man with full eyes, an odd creature, like a child, and like a troll, quick, detached; he bowed slightly; his companion, a large fair young man, stylishly dressed, blushed to the eyes and bowed very low.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It was over.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Herr Loerke was giving us a recitation in the Cologne dialect,'' said the Professor.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''He must forgive us for interrupting him,'' said Gerald, ''we should like very much to hear it.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There was instantly a bowing and an offering of seats. Gudrun and Ursula, Gerald and Birkin sat in the deep sofas against the wall. The room was of naked oiled panelling, like the rest of the house. It had a piano, sofas and chairs, and a couple of tables with books and magazines. In its complete absence of decoration, save for the big, blue stove, it was cosy and pleasant.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Herr Loerke was the little man with the boyish figure, and the round, full, sensitive-looking head, and the quick, full eyes, like a mouse''s. He glanced swiftly from one to the other of the strangers, and held himself aloof.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Please go on with the recitation,'' said the Professor, suavely, with his slight authority. Loerke, who was sitting hunched on the piano stool, blinked and did not answer.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It would be a great pleasure,'' said Ursula, who had been getting the sentence ready, in German, for some minutes.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Then, suddenly, the small, unresponding man swung aside, towards his previous audience and broke forth, exactly as he had broken off; in a controlled, mocking voice, giving an imitation of a quarrel between an old Cologne woman and a railway guard.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â His body was slight and unformed, like a boy''s, but his voice was mature, sardonic, its movement had the flexibility of essential energy, and of a mocking penetrating understanding. Gudrun could not understand a word of his monologue, but she was spell-bound, watching him. He must be an artist, nobody else could have such fine adjustment and singleness. The Germans were doubled up with laughter, hearing his strange droll words, his droll phrases of dialect. And in the midst of their paroxysms, they glanced with deference at the four English strangers, the elect. Gudrun and Ursula were forced to laugh. The room rang with shouts of laughter. The blue eyes of the Professor''s daughters were swimming over with laughter-tears, their clear cheeks were flushed crimson with mirth, their father broke out in the most astonishing peals of hilarity, the students bowed their heads on their knees in excess of joy. Ursula looked round amazed, the laughter was bubbling out of her involuntarily. She looked at Gudrun. Gudrun looked at her, and the two sisters burst out laughing, carried away. Loerke glanced at them swiftly, with his full eyes. Birkin was s#@!%#$ing involuntarily. Gerald Crich sat erect, with a glistening look of amusement on his face. And the laughter crashed out again, in wild paroxysms, the Professor''s daughters were reduced to shaking helplessness, the veins of the Professor''s neck were swollen, his face was purple, he was strangled in ultimate, silent spasms of laughter. The students were shouting half-articulated words that tailed off in helpless explosions. Then suddenly the rapid patter of the artist ceased, there were little whoops of subsiding mirth, Ursula and Gudrun were wiping their eyes, and the Professor was crying loudly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Das war ausgezeichnet, das war famosâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Wirklich famos,'' echoed his exhausted daughters, faintly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And we couldn''t understand it,'' cried Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh leider, leider!'' cried the Professor.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You couldn''t understand it?'' cried the Students, let loose at last in speech with the newcomers. ''Ja, das ist wirklich schade, das ist schade, gnadige Frau. Wissen Sieâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The mixture was made, the newcomers were stirred into the party, like new ingredients, the whole room was alive. Gerald was in his element, he talked freely and excitedly, his face glistened with a strange amusement. Perhaps even Birkin, in the end, would break forth. He was shy and withheld, though full of attention.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula was prevailed upon to sing ''Annie Lowrie,'' as the Professor called it. There was a hush of EXTREME deference. She had never been so flattered in her life. Gudrun accompanied her on the piano, playing from memory.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula had a beautiful ringing voice, but usually no confidence, she spoiled everything. This evening she felt conceited and untrammelled. Birkin was well in the background, she shone almost in reaction, the Germans made her feel fine and infallible, she was liberated into overweening self-confidence. She felt like a bird flying in the air, as her voice soared out, enjoying herself extremely in the balance and flight of the song, like the motion of a bird''s wings that is up in the wind, sliding and playing on the air, she played with sentimentality, supported by rapturous attention. She was very happy, singing that song by herself, full of a conceit of emotion and power, working upon all those people, and upon herself, exerting herself with gratification, giving immeasurable gratification to the Germans.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â At the end, the Germans were all touched with admiring, delicious melancholy, they praised her in soft, reverent voices, they could not say too much.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Wie schon, wie ruhrend! Ach, die Schottischen Lieder, sie haben so viel Stimmung! Aber die gnadige Frau hat eine WUNDERBARE Stimme; die gnadige Frau ist wirklich eine Kunstlerin, aber wirklich!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She was dilated and brilliant, like a flower in the morning sun. She felt Birkin looking at her, as if he were jealous of her, and her breasts thrilled, her veins were all golden. She was as happy as the sun that has just opened above clouds. And everybody seemed so admiring and radiant, it was perfect.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â After dinner she wanted to go out for a minute, to look at the world. The company tried to dissuade herâ€”it was so terribly cold. But just to look, she said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They all four wrapped up warmly, and found themselves in a vague, unsubstantial outdoors of dim snow and ghosts of an upper-world, that made strange shadows before the stars. It was indeed cold, bruisingly, frighteningly, unnaturally cold. Ursula could not believe the air in her nostrils. It seemed conscious, malevolent, purposive in its intense murderous coldness.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Yet it was wonderful, an intoxication, a silence of dim, unrealised snow, of the invisible intervening between her and the visible, between her and the flashing stars. She could see Orion sloping up. How wonderful he was, wonderful enough to make one cry aloud.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And all around was this cradle of snow, and there was firm snow underfoot, that struck with heavy cold through her boot-soles. It was night, and silence. She imagined she could hear the stars. She imagined distinctly she could hear the celestial, musical motion of the stars, quite near at hand. She seemed like a bird flying amongst their harmonious motion.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And she clung close to Birkin. Suddenly she realised she did not know what he was thinking. She did not know where he was ranging.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''My love!'' she said, stopping to look at him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â His face was pale, his eyes dark, there was a faint spark of starlight on them. And he saw her face soft and upturned to him, very near. He kissed her softly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What then?'' he asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you love me?'' she asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Too much,'' he answered quietly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She clung a little closer.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Not too much,'' she pleaded.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Far too much,'' he said, almost sadly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And does it make you sad, that I am everything to you?'' she asked, wistful. He held her close to him, kissing her, and saying, scarcely audible:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No, but I feel like a beggarâ€”I feel poor.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She was silent, looking at the stars now. Then she kissed him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Don''t be a beggar,'' she pleaded, wistfully. ''It isn''t ignominious that you love me.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It is ignominious to feel poor, isn''t it?'' he replied.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Why? Why should it be?'' she asked. He only stood still, in the terribly cold air that moved invisibly over the mountain tops, folding her round with his arms.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I couldn''t bear this cold, eternal place without you,'' he said. ''I couldn''t bear it, it would kill the quick of my life.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She kissed him again, suddenly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you hate it?'' she asked, puzzled, wondering.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''If I couldn''t come near to you, if you weren''t here, I should hate it. I couldn''t bear it,'' he answered.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But the people are nice,'' she said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I mean the stillness, the cold, the frozen eternality,'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She wondered. Then her spirit came home to him, nestling unconscious in him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, it is good we are warm and together,'' she said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And they turned home again. They saw the golden lights of the hotel glowing out in the night of snow-silence, small in the hollow, like a cluster of yellow berries. It seemed like a bunch of sun-sparks, tiny and orange in the midst of the snow-darkness. Behind, was a high shadow of a peak, blotting out the stars, like a ghost.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They drew near to their home. They saw a man come from the dark building, with a lighted lantern which swung golden, and made that his dark feet walked in a halo of snow. He was a small, dark figure in the darkened snow. He unlatched the door of an outhouse. A smell of cows, hot, animal, almost like beef, came out on the heavily cold air. There was a glimpse of two cattle in their dark stalls, then the door was shut again, and not a chink of light showed. It had reminded Ursula again of home, of the Marsh, of her childhood, and of the journey to Brussels, and, strangely, of Anton Skrebensky.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Oh, God, could one bear it, this past which was gone down the abyss? Could she bear, that it ever had been! She looked round this silent, upper world of snow and stars and powerful cold. There was another world, like views on a magic lantern; The Marsh, Cossethay, Ilkeston, lit up with a common, unreal light. There was a shadowy unreal Ursula, a whole shadow-play of an unreal life. It was as unreal, and circumscribed, as a magic-lantern show. She wished the slides could all be broken. She wished it could be gone for ever, like a lantern-slide which was broken. She wanted to have no past. She wanted to have come down from the slopes of heaven to this place, with Birkin, not to have toiled out of the murk of her childhood and her upbringing, slowly, all soiled. She felt that memory was a dirty trick played upon her. What was this decree, that she should ''remember''! Why not a bath of pure oblivion, a new birth, without any recollections or blemish of a past life. She was with Birkin, she had just come into life, here in the high snow, against the stars. What had she to do with parents and antecedents? She knew herself new and unbegotten, she had no father, no mother, no anterior connections, she was herself, pure and silvery, she belonged only to the oneness with Birkin, a oneness that struck deeper notes, sounding into the heart of the universe, the heart of reality, where she had never existed before.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Even Gudrun was a separate unit, separate, separate, having nothing to do with this self, this Ursula, in her new world of reality. That old shadow-world, the actuality of the pastâ€”ah, let it go! She rose free on the wings of her new condition.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun and Gerald had not come in. They had walked up the valley straight in front of the house, not like Ursula and Birkin, on to the little hill at the right. Gudrun was driven by a strange desire. She wanted to plunge on and on, till she came to the end of the valley of snow. Then she wanted to climb the wall of white finality, climb over, into the peaks that sprang up like sharp petals in the heart of the frozen, mysterious navel of the world. She felt that there, over the strange blind, terrible wall of rocky snow, there in the navel of the mystic world, among the final cluster of peaks, there, in the infolded navel of it all, was her consummation. If she could but come there, alone, and pass into the infolded navel of eternal snow and of uprising, immortal peaks of snow and rock, she would be a oneness with all, she would be herself the eternal, infinite silence, the sleeping, timeless, frozen centre of the All.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They went back to the house, to the Reunionsaal. She was curious to see what was going on. The men there made her alert, roused her curiosity. It was a new taste of life for her, they were so prostrate before her, yet so full of life.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The party was boisterous; they were dancing all together, dancing the Schuhplatteln, the Tyrolese dance of the clapping hands and tossing the partner in the air at the crisis. The Germans were all proficientâ€”they were from Munich chiefly. Gerald also was quite passable. There were three zithers twanging away in a corner. It was a scene of great animation and confusion. The Professor was initiating Ursula into the dance, stamping, clapping, and swinging her high, with amazing force and zest. When the crisis came even Birkin was behaving manfully with one of the Professor''s fresh, strong daughters, who was exceedingly happy. Everybody was dancing, there was the most boisterous turmoil.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun looked on with delight. The solid wooden floor resounded to the knocking heels of the men, the air quivered with the clapping hands and the zither music, there was a golden dust about the hanging lamps.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Suddenly the dance finished, Loerke and the students rushed out to bring in drinks. There was an excited clamour of voices, a clinking of mug-lids, a great crying of ''Prositâ€”Prosit!'' Loerke was everywhere at once, like a gnome, suggesting drinks for the women, making an obscure, slightly risky joke with the men, confusing and mystifying the waiter.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He wanted very much to dance with Gudrun. From the first moment he had seen her, he wanted to make a connection with her. Instinctively she felt this, and she waited for him to come up. But a kind of sulkiness kept him away from her, so she thought he disliked her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Will you schuhplatteln, gnadige Frau?'' said the large, fair youth, Loerke''s companion. He was too soft, too humble for Gudrun''s taste. But she wanted to dance, and the fair youth, who was called Leitner, was handsome enough in his uneasy, slightly abject fashion, a humility that covered a certain fear. She accepted him as a partner.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The zithers sounded out again, the dance began. Gerald led them, laughing, with one of the Professor''s daughters. Ursula danced with one of the students, Birkin with the other daughter of the Professor, the Professor with Frau Kramer, and the rest of the men danced together, with quite as much zest as if they had had women partners.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Because Gudrun had danced with the well-built, soft youth, his companion, Loerke, was more pettish and exasperated than ever, and would not even notice her existence in the room. This piqued her, but she made up to herself by dancing with the Professor, who was strong as a mature, well-seasoned bull, and as full of coarse energy. She could not bear him, critically, and yet she enjoyed being rushed through the dance, and tossed up into the air, on his coarse, powerful impetus. The Professor enjoyed it too, he eyed her with strange, large blue eyes, full of galvanic fire. She hated him for the seasoned, semi-paternal animalism with which he regarded her, but she admired his weight of strength.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The room was charged with excitement and strong, animal emotion. Loerke was kept away from Gudrun, to whom he wanted to speak, as by a hedge of thorns, and he felt a sardonic ruthless hatred for this young love-companion, Leitner, who was his penniless dependent. He mocked the youth, with an acid ridicule, that made Leitner red in the face and impotent with resentment.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald, who had now got the dance perfectly, was dancing again with the younger of the Professor''s daughters, who was almost dying of virgin excitement, because she thought Gerald so handsome, so superb. He had her in his power, as if she were a palpitating bird, a fluttering, flushing, bewildered creature. And it made him smile, as she shrank convulsively between his hands, violently, when he must throw her into the air. At the end, she was so overcome with prostrate love for him, that she could scarcely speak sensibly at all.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Birkin was dancing with Ursula. There were odd little fires playing in his eyes, he seemed to have turned into something wicked and flickering, mocking, suggestive, quite impossible. Ursula was frightened of him, and fascinated. Clear, before her eyes, as in a vision, she could see the sardonic, licentious mockery of his eyes, he moved towards her with subtle, animal, indifferent approach. The strangeness of his hands, which came quick and cunning, inevitably to the vital place beneath her breasts, and, lifting with mocking, suggestive impulse, carried her through the air as if without strength, through blackmagic, made her swoon with fear. For a moment she revolted, it was horrible. She would break the spell. But before the resolution had formed she had submitted again, yielded to her fear. He knew all the time what he was doing, she could see it in his smiling, concentrated eyes. It was his responsibility, she would leave it to him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â When they were alone in the darkness, she felt the strange, licentiousness of him hovering upon her. She was troubled and repelled. Why should he turn like this?

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What is it?'' she asked in dread.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But his face only glistened on her, unknown, horrible. And yet she was fascinated. Her impulse was to repel him violently, break from this spell of mocking brutishness. But she was too fascinated, she wanted to submit, she wanted to know. What would he do to her?

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He was so attractive, and so repulsive at one. The sardonic suggestivity that flickered over his face and looked from his narrowed eyes, made her want to hide, to hide herself away from him and watch him from somewhere unseen.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Why are you like this?'' she demanded again, rousing against him with sudden force and animosity.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The flickering fires in his eyes concentrated as he looked into her eyes. Then the lids drooped with a faint motion of satiric contempt. Then they rose again to the same remorseless suggestivity. And she gave way, he might do as he would. His licentiousness was repulsively attractive. But he was self-responsible, she would see what it was.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They might do as they likedâ€”this she realised as she went to sleep. How could anything that gave one satisfaction be excluded? What was degrading? Who cared? Degrading things were real, with a different reality. And he was so unabashed and unrestrained. Wasn''t it rather horrible, a man who could be so soulful and spiritual, now to be soâ€”she balked at her own thoughts and memories: then she addedâ€”so bestial? So bestial, they two!â€”so degraded! She winced. But after all, why not? She exulted as well. Why not be bestial, and go the whole round of experience? She exulted in it. She was bestial. How good it was to be really shameful! There would be no shameful thing she had not experienced. Yet she was unabashed, she was herself. Why not? She was free, when she knew everything, and no dark shameful things were denied her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun, who had been watching Gerald in the Reunionsaal, suddenly thought:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''He should have all the women he canâ€”it is his nature. It is absurd to call him monogamousâ€”he is naturally promiscuous. That is his nature.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The thought came to her involuntarily. It shocked her somewhat. It was as if she had seen some new MENE! MENE! upon the wall. Yet it was merely true. A voice seemed to have spoken it to her so clearly, that for the moment she believed in inspiration.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It is really true,'' she said to herself again.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She knew quite well she had believed it all along. She knew it implicitly. But she must keep it darkâ€”almost from herself. She must keep it completely secret. It was knowledge for her alone, and scarcely even to be admitted to herself.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The deep resolve formed in her, to combat him. One of them must triumph over the other. Which should it be? Her soul steeled itself with strength. Almost she laughed within herself, at her confidence. It woke a certain keen, half contemptuous pity, tenderness for him: she was so ruthless.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Everybody retired early. The Professor and Loerke went into a small lounge to drink. They both watched Gudrun go along the landing by the railing upstairs.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Ein schones Frauenzimmer,'' said the Professor.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Ja!'' asserted Loerke, shortly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald walked with his queer, long wolf-steps across the bedroom to the window, stooped and looked out, then rose again, and turned to Gudrun, his eyes sharp with an abstract smile. He seemed very tall to her, she saw the glisten of his whitish eyebrows, that met between his brows.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''How do you like it?'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He seemed to be laughing inside himself, quite unconsciously. She looked at him. He was a phenomenon to her, not a human being: a sort of creature, greedy.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I like it very much,'' she replied.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Who do you like best downstairs?'' he asked, standing tall and glistening above her, with his glistening stiff hair erect.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Who do I like best?'' she repeated, wanting to answer his question, and finding it difficult to collect herself. ''Why I don''t know, I don''t know enough about them yet, to be able to say. Who do YOU like best?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, I don''t careâ€”I don''t like or dislike any of them. It doesn''t matter about me. I wanted to know about you.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But why?'' she asked, going rather pale. The abstract, unconscious smile in his eyes was intensified.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I wanted to know,'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She turned aside, breaking the spell. In some strange way, she felt he was getting power over her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Well, I can''t tell you already,'' she said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She went to the mirror to take out the hairpins from her hair. She stood before the mirror every night for some minutes, brushing her fine dark hair. It was part of the inevitable ritual of her life.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He followed her, and stood behind her. She was busy with bent head, taking out the pins and shaking her warm hair loose. When she looked up, she saw him in the glass standing behind her, watching unconsciously, not consciously seeing her, and yet watching, with finepupilled eyes that SEEMED to smile, and which were not really smiling.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She started. It took all her courage for her to continue brushing her hair, as usual, for her to pretend she was at her ease. She was far, far from being at her ease with him. She beat her brains wildly for something to say to him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What are your plans for tomorrow?'' she asked nonchalantly, whilst her heart was beating so furiously, her eyes were so bright with strange nervousness, she felt he could not but observe. But she knew also that he was completely blind, blind as a wolf looking at her. It was a strange battle between her ordinary consciousness and his uncanny, black-art consciousness.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I don''t know,'' he replied, ''what would you like to do?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He spoke emptily, his mind was sunk away.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh,'' she said, with easy protestation, ''I''m ready for anythingâ€”anything will be fine for ME, I''m sure.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And to herself she was saying: ''God, why am I so nervousâ€”why are you so nervous, you fool. If he sees it I''m done for foreverâ€”you KNOW you''re done for forever, if he sees the absurd state you''re in.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And she smiled to herself as if it were all child''s play. Meanwhile her heart was plunging, she was almost fainting. She could see him, in the mirror, as he stood there behind her, tall and over-archingâ€”blond and terribly frightening. She glanced at his reflection with furtive eyes, willing to give anything to save him from knowing she could see him. He did not know she could see his reflection. He was looking unconsciously, glisteningly down at her head, from which the hair fell loose, as she brushed it with wild, nervous hand. She held her head aside and brushed and brushed her hair madly. For her life, she could not turn round and face him. For her life, SHE COULD NOT. And the knowledge made her almost sink to the ground in a faint, helpless, spent. She was aware of his frightening, impending figure standing close behind her, she was aware of his hard, strong, unyielding chest, close upon her back. And she felt she could not bear it any more, in a few minutes she would fall down at his feet, grovelling at his feet, and letting him destroy her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The thought pricked up all her sharp intelligence and presence of mind. She dared not turn round to himâ€”and there he stood motionless, unbroken. Summoning all her strength, she said, in a full, resonant, nonchalant voice, that was forced out with all her remaining self-control:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, would you mind looking in that bag behind there and giving me myâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Here her power fell inert. ''My whatâ€”my whatâ€”?'' she screamed in silence to herself.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But he had started round, surprised and startled that she should ask him to look in her bag, which she always kept so VERY private to herself.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She turned now, her face white, her dark eyes blazing with uncanny, overwrought excitement. She saw him stooping to the bag, undoing the loosely buckled strap, unattentive.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Your what?'' he asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, a little enamel boxâ€”yellowâ€”with a design of a cormorant plucking her breastâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She went towards him, stooping her beautiful, bare arm, and deftly turned some of her things, disclosing the box, which was exquisitely painted.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''That is it, see,'' she said, taking it from under his eyes.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And he was baffled now. He was left to fasten up the bag, whilst she swiftly did up her hair for the night, and sat down to unfasten her shoes. She would not turn her back to him any more.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He was baffled, frustrated, but unconscious. She had the whip hand over him now. She knew he had not realised her terrible panic. Her heart was beating heavily still. Fool, fool that she was, to get into such a state! How she thanked God for Gerald''s obtuse blindness. Thank God he could see nothing.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She sat slowly unlacing her shoes, and he too commenced to undress. Thank God that crisis was over. She felt almost fond of him now, almost in love with him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Ah, Gerald,'' she laughed, caressively, teasingly, ''Ah, what a fine game you played with the Professor''s daughterâ€”didn''t you now?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What game?'' he asked, looking round.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''ISN''T she in love with youâ€”oh DEAR, isn''t she in love with you!'' said Gudrun, in her gayest, most attractive mood.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I shouldn''t think so,'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Shouldn''t think so!'' she teased. ''Why the poor girl is lying at this moment overwhelmed, dying with love for you. She thinks you''re WONDERFULâ€”oh marvellous, beyond what man has ever been. REALLY, isn''t it funny?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Why funny, what is funny?'' he asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Why to see you working it on her,'' she said, with a half reproach that confused the male conceit in him. ''Really Gerald, the poor girlâ€”!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I did nothing to her,'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, it was too shameful, the way you simply swept her off her feet.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''That was Schuhplatteln,'' he replied, with a bright grin.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Haâ€”haâ€”ha!'' laughed Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Her mockery quivered through his muscles with curious re-echoes. When he slept he seemed to crouch down in the bed, lapped up in his own strength, that yet was hollow.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And Gudrun slept strongly, a victorious sleep. Suddenly, she was almost fiercely awake. The small timber room glowed with the dawn, that came upwards from the low window. She could see down the valley when she lifted her head: the snow with a pinkish, half-revealed magic, the fringe of pine-trees at the bottom of the slope. And one tiny figure moved over the vaguely-illuminated space.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She glanced at his watch; it was seven o''clock. He was still completely asleep. And she was so hard awake, it was almost frighteningâ€”a hard, metallic wakefulness. She lay looking at him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He slept in the subjection of his own health and defeat. She was overcome by a sincere regard for him. Till now, she was afraid before him. She lay and thought about him, what he was, what he represented in the world. A fine, independent will, he had. She thought of the revolution he had worked in the mines, in so short a time. She knew that, if he were confronted with any problem, any hard actual difficulty, he would overcome it. If he laid hold of any idea, he would carry it through. He had the faculty of making order out of confusion. Only let him grip hold of a situation, and he would bring to pass an inevitable conclusion.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â For a few moments she was borne away on the wild wings of ambition. Gerald, with his force of will and his power for comprehending the actual world, should be set to solve the problems of the day, the problem of industrialism in the modern world. She knew he would, in the course of time, effect the changes he desired, he could re-organise the industrial system. She knew he could do it. As an instrument, in these things, he was marvellous, she had never seen any man with his potentiality. He was unaware of it, but she knew.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He only needed to be hitched on, he needed that his hand should be set to the task, because he was so unconscious. And this she could do. She would marry him, he would go into Parliament in the Conservative interest, he would clear up the great muddle of labour and industry. He was so superbly fearless, masterful, he knew that every problem could be worked out, in life as in geometry. And he would care neither about himself nor about anything but the pure working out of the problem. He was very pure, really.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Her heart beat fast, she flew away on wings of elation, imagining a future. He would be a Napoleon of peace, or a Bismarckâ€”and she the woman behind him. She had read Bismarck''s letters, and had been deeply moved by them. And Gerald would be freer, more dauntless than Bismarck.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But even as she lay in fictitious transport, bathed in the strange, false sunshine of hope in life, something seemed to snap in her, and a terrible cynicism began to gain upon her, blowing in like a wind. Everything turned to irony with her: the last flavour of everything was ironical. When she felt her pang of undeniable reality, this was when she knew the hard irony of hopes and ideas.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She lay and looked at him, as he slept. He was sheerly beautiful, he was a perfect instrument. To her mind, he was a pure, inhuman, almost superhuman instrument. His instrumentality appealed so strongly to her, she wished she were God, to use him as a tool.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And at the same instant, came the ironical question: ''What for?'' She thought of the colliers'' wives, with their linoleum and their lace curtains and their little girls in high-laced boots. She thought of the wives and daughters of the pit-managers, their tennis-parties, and their terrible struggles to be superior each to the other, in the social scale. There was Shortlands with its meaningless distinction, the meaningless crowd of the Criches. There was London, the House of Commons, the extant social world. My God!

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Young as she was, Gudrun had touched the whole pulse of social England. She had no ideas of rising in the world. She knew, with the perfect cynicism of cruel youth, that to rise in the world meant to have one outside show instead of another, the advance was like having a spurious half-crown instead of a spurious penny. The whole coinage of valuation was spurious. Yet of course, her cynicism knew well enough that, in a world where spurious coin was current, a bad sovereign was better than a bad farthing. But rich and poor, she despised both alike.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Already she mocked at herself for her dreams. They could be fulfilled easily enough. But she recognised too well, in her spirit, the mockery of her own impulses. What did she care, that Gerald had created a richly-paying industry out of an old worn-out concern? What did she care? The worn-out concern and the rapid, splendidly organised industry, they were bad money. Yet of course, she cared a great deal, outwardlyâ€”and outwardly was all that mattered, for inwardly was a bad joke.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Everything was intrinsically a piece of irony to her. She leaned over Gerald and said in her heart, with compassion:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, my dear, my dear, the game isn''t worth even you. You are a fine thing reallyâ€”why should you be used on such a poor show!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Her heart was breaking with pity and grief for him. And at the same moment, a grimace came over her mouth, of mocking irony at her own unspoken tirade. Ah, what a farce it was! She thought of Parnell and Katherine O''Shea. Parnell! After all, who can take the nationalisation of Ireland seriously? Who can take political Ireland really seriously, whatever it does? And who can take political England seriously? Who can? Who can care a straw, really, how the old patched-up Constitution is tinkered at any more? Who cares a button for our national ideas, any more than for our national bowler hat? Aha, it is all old hat, it is all old bowler hat!

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â That''s all it is, Gerald, my young hero. At any rate we''ll spare ourselves the nausea of stirring the old broth any more. You be beautiful, my Gerald, and reckless. There ARE perfect moments. Wake up, Gerald, wake up, convince me of the perfect moments. Oh, convince me, I need it.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He opened his eyes, and looked at her. She greeted him with a mocking, enigmatic smile in which was a poignant gaiety. Over his face went the reflection of the smile, he smiled, too, purely unconsciously.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â That filled her with extraordinary delight, to see the smile cross his face, reflected from her face. She remembered that was how a baby smiled. It filled her with extraordinary radiant delight.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You''ve done it,'' she said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What?'' he asked, dazed.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Convinced me.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And she bent down, kissing him passionately, passionately, so that he was bewildered. He did not ask her of what he had convinced her, though he meant to. He was glad she was kissing him. She seemed to be feeling for his very heart to touch the quick of him. And he wanted her to touch the quick of his being, he wanted that most of all.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Outside, somebody was singing, in a manly, reckless handsome voice:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Mach mir auf, mach mir auf, du Stolze,
Mach mir ein Feuer von Holze.
Vom Regen bin ich nass
Vom Regen bin ich nass-''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun knew that that song would sound through her eternity, sung in a manly, reckless, mocking voice. It marked one of her supreme moments, the supreme pangs of her nervous gratification. There it was, fixed in eternity for her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The day came fine and bluish. There was a light wind blowing among the mountain tops, keen as a rapier where it touched, carrying with it a fine dust of snow-powder. Gerald went out with the fine, blind face of a man who is in his state of fulfilment. Gudrun and he were in perfect static unity this morning, but unseeing and unwitting. They went out with a toboggan, leaving Ursula and Birkin to follow.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun was all scarlet and royal blueâ€”a scarlet jersey and cap, and a royal blue skirt and stockings. She went gaily over the white snow, with Gerald beside her, in white and grey, pulling the little toboggan. They grew small in the distance of snow, climbing the steep slope.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â For Gudrun herself, she seemed to pass altogether into the whiteness of the snow, she became a pure, thoughtless crystal. When she reached the top of the slope, in the wind, she looked round, and saw peak beyond peak of rock and snow, bluish, transcendent in heaven. And it seemed to her like a garden, with the peaks for pure flowers, and her heart gathering them. She had no separate consciousness for Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She held on to him as they went sheering down over the keen slope. She felt as if her senses were being whetted on some fine grindstone, that was keen as flame. The snow sprinted on either side, like sparks from a blade that is being sharpened, the whiteness round about ran swifter, swifter, in pure flame the white slope flew against her, and she fused like one molten, dancing globule, rushed through a white intensity. Then there was a great swerve at the bottom, when they swung as it were in a fall to earth, in the diminishing motion.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They came to rest. But when she rose to her feet, she could not stand. She gave a strange cry, turned and clung to him, sinking her face on his breast, fainting in him. Utter oblivion came over her, as she lay for a few moments abandoned against him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What is it?'' he was saying. ''Was it too much for you?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But she heard nothing.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â When she came to, she stood up and looked round, astonished. Her face was white, her eyes brilliant and large.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What is it?'' he repeated. ''Did it upset you?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She looked at him with her brilliant eyes that seemed to have undergone some transfiguration, and she laughed, with a terrible merriment.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No,'' she cried, with triumphant joy. ''It was the complete moment of my life.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And she looked at him with her dazzling, overweening laughter, like one possessed. A fine blade seemed to enter his heart, but he did not care, or take any notice.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But they climbed up the slope again, and they flew down through the white flame again, splendidly, splendidly. Gudrun was laughing and flashing, powdered with snow-crystals, Gerald worked perfectly. He felt he could guide the toboggan to a hair-breadth, almost he could make it pierce into the air and right into the very heart of the sky. It seemed to him the flying sledge was but his strength spread out, he had but to move his arms, the motion was his own. They explored the great slopes, to find another slide. He felt there must be something better than they had known. And he found what he desired, a perfect long, fierce sweep, sheering past the foot of a rock and into the trees at the base. It was dangerous, he knew. But then he knew also he would direct the sledge between his fingers.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The first days passed in an ecstasy of physical motion, sleighing, skiing, skating, moving in an intensity of speed and white light that surpassed life itself, and carried the souls of the human beings beyond into an inhuman abstraction of velocity and weight and eternal, frozen snow.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald''s eyes became hard and strange, and as he went by on his skis he was more like some powerful, fateful sigh than a man, his muscles elastic in a perfect, soaring trajectory, his body projected in pure flight, mindless, soulless, whirling along one perfect line of force.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Luckily there came a day of snow, when they must all stay indoors: otherwise Birkin said, they would all lose their faculties, and begin to utter themselves in cries and shrieks, like some strange, unknown species of snow-creatures.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It happened in the afternoon that Ursula sat in the Reunionsaal talking to Loerke. The latter had seemed unhappy lately. He was lively and full of mischievous humour, as usual.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But Ursula had thought he was sulky about something. His partner, too, the big, fair, good-looking youth, was ill at ease, going about as if he belonged to nowhere, and was kept in some sort of subjection, against which he was rebelling.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Loerke had hardly talked to Gudrun. His associate, on the other hand, had paid her constantly a soft, over-deferential attention. Gudrun wanted to talk to Loerke. He was a sculptor, and she wanted to hear his view of his art. And his figure attracted her. There was the look of a little wastrel about him, that intrigued her, and an old man''s look, that interested her, and then, beside this, an uncanny singleness, a quality of being by himself, not in contact with anybody else, that marked out an artist to her. He was a chatterer, a magpie, a maker of mischievous word-jokes, that were sometimes very clever, but which often were not. And she could see in his brown, gnome''s eyes, the black look of inorganic misery, which lay behind all his small buffoonery.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â His figure interested herâ€”the figure of a boy, almost a street arab. He made no attempt to conceal it. He always wore a simple loden suit, with knee breeches. His legs were thin, and he made no attempt to disguise the fact: which was of itself remarkable, in a German. And he never ingratiated himself anywhere, not in the slightest, but kept to himself, for all his apparent playfulness.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Leitner, his companion, was a great sportsman, very handsome with his big limbs and his blue eyes. Loerke would go toboganning or skating, in little snatches, but he was indifferent. And his fine, thin nostrils, the nostrils of a pure-bred street arab, would quiver with contempt at Leitner''s splothering gymnastic displays. It was evident that the two men who had travelled and lived together, sharing the same bedroom, had now reached the stage of loathing. Leitner hated Loerke with an injured, writhing, impotent hatred, and Loerke treated Leitner with a fine-quivering contempt and sarcasm. Soon the two would have to go apart.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Already they were rarely together. Leitner ran attaching himself to somebody or other, always deferring, Loerke was a good deal alone. Out of doors he wore a Westphalian cap, a close brown-velvet head with big brown velvet flaps down over his ears, so that he looked like a lop-eared rabbit, or a troll. His face was brown-red, with a dry, bright skin, that seemed to crinkle with his mobile expressions. His eyes were arrestingâ€”brown, full, like a rabbit''s, or like a troll''s, or like the eyes of a lost being, having a strange, dumb, depraved look of knowledge, and a quick spark of uncanny fire. Whenever Gudrun had tried to talk to him he had shied away unresponsive, looking at her with his watchful dark eyes, but entering into no relation with her. He had made her feel that her slow French and her slower German, were hateful to him. As for his own inadequate English, he was much too awkward to try it at all. But he understood a good deal of what was said, nevertheless. And Gudrun, piqued, left him alone.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This afternoon, however, she came into the lounge as he was talking to Ursula. His fine, black hair somehow reminded her of a bat, thin as it was on his full, sensitive-looking head, and worn away at the temples. He sat hunched up, as if his spirit were bat-like. And Gudrun could see he was making some slow confidence to Ursula, unwilling, a slow, grudging, scanty self-revelation. She went and sat by her sister.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He looked at her, then looked away again, as if he took no notice of her. But as a matter of fact, she interested him deeply.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Isn''t it interesting, Prune,'' said Ursula, turning to her sister, ''Herr Loerke is doing a great frieze for a factory in Cologne, for the outside, the street.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She looked at him, at his thin, brown, nervous hands, that were prehensile, and somehow like talons, like ''griffes,'' inhuman.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What IN?'' she asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''AUS WAS?'' repeated Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''GRANIT,'' he replied.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It had become immediately a laconic series of question and answer between fellow craftsmen.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What is the relief?'' asked Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Alto relievo.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And at what height?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It was very interesting to Gudrun to think of his making the great granite frieze for a great granite factory in Cologne. She got from him some notion of the design. It was a representation of a fair, with peasants and artisans in an orgy of enjoyment, drunk and absurd in their modern dress, whirling ridiculously in roundabouts, gaping at shows, kissing and staggering and rolling in knots, swinging in swing-boats, and firing down shooting galleries, a frenzy of chaotic motion.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There was a swift discussion of technicalities. Gudrun was very much impressed.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But how wonderful, to have such a factory!'' cried Ursula. ''Is the whole building fine?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh yes,'' he replied. ''The frieze is part of the whole architecture. Yes, it is a colossal thing.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Then he seemed to stiffen, shrugged his shoulders, and went on:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Sculpture and architecture must go together. The day for irrelevant statues, as for wall pictures, is over. As a matter of fact sculpture is always part of an architectural conception. And since churches are all museum stuff, since industry is our business, now, then let us make our places of industry our artâ€”our factory-area our Parthenon, ECCO!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula pondered.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I suppose,'' she said, ''there is no NEED for our great works to be so hideous.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Instantly he broke into motion.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''There you are!'' he cried, ''there you are! There is not only NO NEED for our places of work to be ugly, but their ugliness ruins the work, in the end. Men will not go on submitting to such intolerable ugliness. In the end it will hurt too much, and they will wither because of it. And this will wither the WORK as well. They will think the work itself is ugly: the machines, the very act of labour. Whereas the machinery and the acts of labour are extremely, maddeningly beautiful. But this will be the end of our civilisation, when people will not work because work has become so intolerable to their senses, it nauseates them too much, they would rather starve. THEN we shall see the hammer used only for smashing, then we shall see it. Yet here we areâ€”we have the opportunity to make beautiful factories, beautiful machine-housesâ€”we have the opportunityâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun could only partly understand. She could have cried with vexation.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What does he say?'' she asked Ursula. And Ursula translated, stammering and brief. Loerke watched Gudrun''s face, to see her judgment.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And do you think then,'' said Gudrun, ''that art should serve industry?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Art should INTERPRET industry, as art once interpreted religion,'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But does your fair interpret industry?'' she asked him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Certainly. What is man doing, when he is at a fair like this? He is fulfilling the counterpart of labourâ€”the machine works him, instead of he the machine. He enjoys the mechanical motion, in his own body.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But is there nothing but workâ€”mechanical work?'' said Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Nothing but work!'' he repeated, leaning forward, his eyes two darknesses, with needle-points of light. ''No, it is nothing but this, serving a machine, or enjoying the motion of a machineâ€”motion, that is all. You have never worked for hunger, or you would know what god governs us.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun quivered and flushed. For some reason she was almost in tears.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No, I have not worked for hunger,'' she replied, ''but I have worked!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Travailleâ€”lavorato?'' he asked. ''E che lavoroâ€”che lavoro? Quel travail est-ce que vous avez fait?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He broke into a mixture of Italian and French, instinctively using a foreign language when he spoke to her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You have never worked as the world works,'' he said to her, with sarcasm.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' she said. ''I have. And I doâ€”I work now for my daily bread.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He paused, looked at her steadily, then dropped the subject entirely. She seemed to him to be trifling.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But have YOU ever worked as the world works?'' Ursula asked him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He looked at her untrustful.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' he replied, with a surly bark. ''I have known what it was to lie in bed for three days, because I had nothing to eat.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun was looking at him with large, grave eyes, that seemed to draw the confession from him as the marrow from his bones. All his nature held him back from confessing. And yet her large, grave eyes upon him seemed to open some valve in his veins, and involuntarily he was telling.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''My father was a man who did not like work, and we had no mother. We lived in Austria, Polish Austria. How did we live? Ha!â€”somehow! Mostly in a room with three other familiesâ€”one set in each cornerâ€”and the W.C. in the middle of the roomâ€”a pan with a plank on itâ€”ha! I had two brothers and a sisterâ€”and there might be a woman with my father. He was a free being, in his wayâ€”would fight with any man in the townâ€”a garrison townâ€”and was a little man too. But he wouldn''t work for anybodyâ€”set his heart against it, and wouldn''t.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And how did you live then?'' asked Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He looked at herâ€”then, suddenly, at Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you understand?'' he asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Enough,'' she replied.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Their eyes met for a moment. Then he looked away. He would say no more.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And how did you become a sculptor?'' asked Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''How did I become a sculptorâ€”'' he paused. ''Dunqueâ€”'' he resumed, in a changed manner, and beginning to speak Frenchâ€”''I became old enoughâ€”I used to steal from the market-place. Later I went to workâ€”imprinted the stamp on clay bottles, before they were baked. It was an earthenware-bottle factory. There I began making models. One day, I had had enough. I lay in the sun and did not go to work. Then I walked to Munichâ€”then I walked to Italyâ€”begging, begging everything.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''The Italians were very good to meâ€”they were good and honourable to me. From Bozen to Rome, almost every night I had a meal and a bed, perhaps of straw, with some peasant. I love the Italian people, with all my heart.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Dunque, adessoâ€”maintenantâ€”I earn a thousand pounds in a year, or I earn two thousandâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He looked down at the ground, his voice tailing off into silence.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun looked at his fine, thin, shiny skin, reddish-brown from the sun, drawn tight over his full temples; and at his thin hairâ€”and at the thick, coarse, brush-like moustache, cut short about his mobile, rather shapeless mouth.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''How old are you?'' she asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He looked up at her with his full, elfin eyes startled.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''WIE ALT?'' he repeated. And he hesitated. It was evidently one of his reticencies.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''How old are YOU?'' he replied, without answering.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I am twenty-six,'' she answered.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Twenty-six,'' he repeated, looking into her eyes. He paused. Then he said:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''UND IHR HERR GEMAHL, WIE ALT IS ER?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Who?'' asked Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Your husband,'' said Ursula, with a certain irony.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I haven''t got a husband,'' said Gudrun in English. In German she answered,

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''He is thirty-one.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But Loerke was watching closely, with his uncanny, full, suspicious eyes. Something in Gudrun seemed to accord with him. He was really like one of the ''little people'' who have no soul, who has found his mate in a human being. But he suffered in his discovery. She too was fascinated by him, fascinated, as if some strange creature, a rabbit or a bat, or a brown seal, had begun to talk to her. But also, she knew what he was unconscious of, his tremendous power of understanding, of apprehending her living motion. He did not know his own power. He did not know how, with his full, submerged, watchful eyes, he could look into her and see her, what she was, see her secrets. He would only want her to be herselfâ€”he knew her verily, with a subconscious, sinister knowledge, devoid of illusions and hopes.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To Gudrun, there was in Loerke the rock-bottom of all life. Everybody else had their illusion, must have their illusion, their before and after. But he, with a perfect stoicism, did without any before and after, dispensed with all illusion. He did not deceive himself in the last issue. In the last issue he cared about nothing, he was troubled about nothing, he made not the slightest attempt to be at one with anything. He existed a pure, unconnected will, stoical and momentaneous. There was only his work.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It was curious too, how his poverty, the degradation of his earlier life, attracted her. There was something insipid and tasteless to her, in the idea of a gentleman, a man who had gone the usual course through school and university. A certain violent sympathy, however, came up in her for this mud-child. He seemed to be the very stuff of the underworld of life. There was no going beyond him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula too was attracted by Loerke. In both sisters he commanded a certain homage. But there were moments when to Ursula he seemed indescribably inferior, false, a vulgarism.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Both Birkin and Gerald disliked him, Gerald ignoring him with some contempt, Birkin exasperated.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?'' Gerald asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''God alone knows,'' replied Birkin, ''unless it''s some sort of appeal he makes to them, which flatters them and has such a power over them.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald looked up in surprise.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''DOES he make an appeal to them?'' he asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh yes,'' replied Birkin. ''He is the perfectly subjected being, existing almost like a criminal. And the women rush towards that, like a current of air towards a vacuum.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Funny they should rush to that,'' said Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Makes one mad, too,'' said Birkin. ''But he has the fascination of pity and repulsion for them, a little obscene monster of the darkness that he is.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald stood still, suspended in thought.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What DO women want, at the bottom?'' he asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Birkin shrugged his shoulders.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''God knows,'' he said. ''Some satisfaction in basic repulsion, it seems to me. They seem to creep down some ghastly tunnel of darkness, and will never be satisfied till they''ve come to the end.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald looked out into the mist of fine snow that was blowing by. Everywhere was blind today, horribly blind.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And what is the end?'' he asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Birkin shook his head.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I''ve not got there yet, so I don''t know. Ask Loerke, he''s pretty near. He is a good many stages further than either you or I can go.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, but stages further in what?'' cried Gerald, irritated.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Birkin sighed, and gathered his brows into a knot of anger.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Stages further in social hatred,'' he said. ''He lives like a rat, in the river of corruption, just where it falls over into the bottomless pit. He''s further on than we are. He hates the ideal more acutely. He HATES the ideal utterly, yet it still dominates him. I expect he is a Jewâ€”or part Jewish.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Probably,'' said Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''He is a gnawing little negation, gnawing at the roots of life.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But why does anybody care about him?'' cried Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Because they hate the ideal also, in their souls. They want to explore the sewers, and he''s the wizard rat that swims ahead.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Still Gerald stood and stared at the blind haze of snow outside.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I don''t understand your terms, really,'' he said, in a flat, doomed voice. ''But it sounds a rum sort of desire.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I suppose we want the same,'' said Birkin. ''Only we want to take a quick jump downwards, in a sort of ecstasyâ€”and he ebbs with the stream, the sewer stream.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Meanwhile Gudrun and Ursula waited for the next opportunity to talk to Loerke. It was no use beginning when the men were there. Then they could get into no touch with the isolated little sculptor. He had to be alone with them. And he preferred Ursula to be there, as a sort of transmitter to Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you do nothing but architectural sculpture?'' Gudrun asked him one evening.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Not now,'' he replied. ''I have done all sortsâ€”except portraitsâ€”I never did portraits. But other thingsâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What kind of things?'' asked Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He paused a moment, then rose, and went out of the room. He returned almost immediately with a little roll of paper, which he handed to her. She unrolled it. It was a photogravure reproduction of a statuette, signed F. Loerke.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''That is quite an early thingâ€”NOT mechanical,'' he said, ''more popular.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The statuette was of a naked girl, small, finely made, sitting on a great naked horse. The girl was young and tender, a mere bud. She was sitting sideways on the horse, her face in her hands, as if in shame and grief, in a little abandon. Her hair, which was short and must be flaxen, fell forward, divided, half covering her hands.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Her limbs were young and tender. Her legs, scarcely formed yet, the legs of a maiden just passing towards cruel womanhood, dangled childishly over the side of the powerful horse, pathetically, the small feet folded one over the other, as if to hide. But there was no hiding. There she was exposed naked on the naked flank of the horse.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The horse stood stock still, stretched in a kind of start. It was a massive, magnificent stallion, rigid with pent-up power. Its neck was arched and terrible, like a sickle, its flanks were pressed back, rigid with power.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun went pale, and a darkness came over her eyes, like shame, she looked up with a certain supplication, almost slave-like. He glanced at her, and jerked his head a little.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''How big is it?'' she asked, in a toneless voice, persisting in appearing casual and unaffected.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''How big?'' he replied, glancing again at her. ''Without pedestalâ€”so highâ€”'' he measured with his handâ€”''with pedestal, soâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He looked at her steadily. There was a little brusque, turgid contempt for her in his swift gesture, and she seemed to cringe a little.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And what is it done in?'' she asked, throwing back her head and looking at him with affected coldness.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He still gazed at her steadily, and his dominance was not shaken.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Bronzeâ€”green bronze.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Green bronze!'' repeated Gudrun, coldly accepting his challenge. She was thinking of the slender, immature, tender limbs of the girl, smooth and cold in green bronze.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, beautiful,'' she murmured, looking up at him with a certain dark homage.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He closed his eyes and looked aside, triumphant.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Why,'' said Ursula, ''did you make the horse so stiff? It is as stiff as a block.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Stiff?'' he repeated, in arms at once.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes. LOOK how stock and stupid and brutal it is. Horses are sensitive, quite delicate and sensitive, really.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He raised his shoulders, spread his hands in a shrug of slow indifference, as much as to inform her she was an amateur and an impertinent nobody.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Wissen Sie,'' he said, with an insulting patience and condescension in his voice, ''that horse is a certain FORM, part of a whole form. It is part of a work of art, a piece of form. It is not a picture of a friendly horse to which you give a lump of sugar, do you seeâ€”it is part of a work of art, it has no relation to anything outside that work of art.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula, angry at being treated quite so insultingly DE HAUT EN BAS, from the height of esoteric art to the depth of general exoteric amateurism, replied, hotly, flushing and lifting her face.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But it IS a picture of a horse, nevertheless.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He lifted his shoulders in another shrug.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''As you likeâ€”it is not a picture of a cow, certainly.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Here Gudrun broke in, flushed and brilliant, anxious to avoid any more of this, any more of Ursula''s foolish persistence in giving herself away.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What do you mean by "it is a picture of a horse?"'' she cried at her sister. ''What do you mean by a horse? You mean an idea you have in YOUR head, and which you want to see represented. There is another idea altogether, quite another idea. Call it a horse if you like, or say it is not a horse. I have just as much right to say that YOUR horse isn''t a horse, that it is a falsity of your own make-up.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula wavered, baffled. Then her words came.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But why does he have this idea of a horse?'' she said. ''I know it is his idea. I know it is a picture of himself, reallyâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Loerke snorted with rage.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''A picture of myself!'' he repeated, in derision. ''Wissen sie, gnadige Frau, that is a Kunstwerk, a work of art. It is a work of art, it is a picture of nothing, of absolutely nothing. It has nothing to do with anything but itself, it has no relation with the everyday world of this and other, there is no connection between them, absolutely none, they are two different and distinct planes of existence, and to translate one into the other is worse than foolish, it is a darkening of all counsel, a making confusion everywhere. Do you see, you MUST NOT confuse the relative work of action, with the absolute world of art. That you MUST NOT DO.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''That is quite true,'' cried Gudrun, let loose in a sort of rhapsody. ''The two things are quite and permanently apart, they have NOTHING to do with one another. I and my art, they have nothing to do with each other. My art stands in another world, I am in this world.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Her face was flushed and transfigured. Loerke who was sitting with his head ducked, like some creature at bay, looked up at her, swiftly, almost furtively, and murmured,

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Jaâ€”so ist es, so ist es.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula was silent after this outburst. She was furious. She wanted to poke a hole into them both.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''It isn''t a word of it true, of all this harangue you have made me,'' she replied flatly. ''The horse is a picture of your own stock, stupid brutality, and the girl was a girl you loved and tortured and then ignored.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He looked up at her with a small smile of contempt in his eyes. He would not trouble to answer this last charge.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun too was silent in exasperated contempt. Ursula WAS such an insufferable outsider, rushing in where angels would fear to tread. But thenâ€”fools must be suffered, if not gladly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But Ursula was persistent too.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''As for your world of art and your world of reality,'' she replied, ''you have to separate the two, because you can''t bear to know what you are. You can''t bear to realise what a stock, stiff, hide-bound brutality you ARE really, so you say "it''s the world of art." The world of art is only the truth about the real world, that''s allâ€”but you are too far gone to see it.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She was white and trembling, intent. Gudrun and Loerke sat in stiff dislike of her. Gerald too, who had come up in the beginning of the speech, stood looking at her in complete disapproval and opposition. He felt she was undignified, she put a sort of vulgarity over the esotericism which gave man his last distinction. He joined his forces with the other two. They all three wanted her to go away. But she sat on in silence, her soul weeping, throbbing violently, her fingers twisting her handkerchief.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The others maintained a dead silence, letting the display of Ursula''s obtrusiveness pass by. Then Gudrun asked, in a voice that was quite cool and casual, as if resuming a casual conversation:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Was the girl a model?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Nein, sie war kein Modell. Sie war eine kleine Malschulerin.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''An art-student!'' replied Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And how the situation revealed itself to her! She saw the girl art-student, unformed and of pernicious recklessness, too young, her straight flaxen hair cut short, hanging just into her neck, curving inwards slightly, because it was rather thick; and Loerke, the well-known master-sculptor, and the girl, probably well-brought-up, and of good family, thinking herself so great to be his mistress. Oh how well she knew the common callousness of it all. Dresden, Paris, or London, what did it matter? She knew it.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Where is she now?'' Ursula asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Loerke raised his shoulders, to convey his complete ignorance and indifference.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''That is already six years ago,'' he said; ''she will be twenty-three years old, no more good.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald had picked up the picture and was looking at it. It attracted him also. He saw on the pedestal, that the piece was called ''Lady Godiva.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But this isn''t Lady Godiva,'' he said, smiling good-humouredly. ''She was the middle-aged wife of some Earl or other, who covered herself with her long hair.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''A la Maud Allan,'' said Gudrun with a mocking grimace.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Why Maud Allan?'' he replied. ''Isn''t it so? I always thought the legend was that.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, Gerald dear, I''m quite SURE you''ve got the legend perfectly.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She was laughing at him, with a little, mock-caressive contempt.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''To be sure, I''d rather see the woman than the hair,'' he laughed in return.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Wouldn''t you just!'' mocked Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula rose and went away, leaving the three together.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun took the picture again from Gerald, and sat looking at it closely.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Of course,'' she said, turning to tease Loerke now, ''you UNDERSTOOD your little Malschulerin.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He raised his eyebrows and his shoulders in a complacent shrug.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''The little girl?'' asked Gerald, pointing to the figure.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun was sitting with the picture in her lap. She looked up at Gerald, full into his eyes, so that he seemed to be blinded.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''DIDN''T he understand her!'' she said to Gerald, in a slightly mocking, humorous playfulness. ''You''ve only to look at the feetâ€”AREN''T they darling, so pretty and tenderâ€”oh, they''re really wonderful, they are reallyâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She lifted her eyes slowly, with a hot, flaming look into Loerke''s eyes. His soul was filled with her burning recognition, he seemed to grow more uppish and lordly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald looked at the small, sculptured feet. They were turned together, half covering each other in pathetic shyness and fear. He looked at them a long time, fascinated. Then, in some pain, he put the picture away from him. He felt full of barrenness.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''What was her name?'' Gudrun asked Loerke.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Annette von Weck,'' Loerke replied reminiscent. ''Ja, sie war hubsch. She was prettyâ€”but she was tiresome. She was a nuisance,â€”not for a minute would she keep stillâ€”not until I''d slapped her hard and made her cryâ€”then she''d sit for five minutes.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He was thinking over the work, his work, the all important to him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Did you really slap her?'' asked Gudrun, coolly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He glanced back at her, reading her challenge.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, I did,'' he said, nonchalant, ''harder than I have ever beat anything in my life. I had to, I had to. It was the only way I got the work done.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun watched him with large, dark-filled eyes, for some moments. She seemed to be considering his very soul. Then she looked down, in silence.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Why did you have such a young Godiva then?'' asked Gerald. ''She is so small, besides, on the horseâ€”not big enough for itâ€”such a child.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A queer spasm went over Loerke''s face.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' he said. ''I don''t like them any bigger, any older. Then they are beautiful, at sixteen, seventeen, eighteenâ€”after that, they are no use to me.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There was a moment''s pause.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Why not?'' asked Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Loerke shrugged his shoulders.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I don''t find them interestingâ€”or beautifulâ€”they are no good to me, for my work.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you mean to say a woman isn''t beautiful after she is twenty?'' asked Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''For me, no. Before twenty, she is small and fresh and tender and slight. After thatâ€”let her be what she likes, she has nothing for me. The Venus of Milo is a bourgeoiseâ€”so are they all.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And you don''t care for women at all after twenty?'' asked Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''They are no good to me, they are of no use in my art,'' Loerke repeated impatiently. ''I don''t find them beautiful.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You are an epicure,'' said Gerald, with a slight sarcastic laugh.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And what about men?'' asked Gudrun suddenly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, they are good at all ages,'' replied Loerke. ''A man should be big and powerfulâ€”whether he is old or young is of no account, so he has the size, something of massiveness andâ€”and stupid form.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula went out alone into the world of pure, new snow. But the dazzling whiteness seemed to beat upon her till it hurt her, she felt the cold was slowly strangling her soul. Her head felt dazed and numb.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Suddenly she wanted to go away. It occurred to her, like a miracle, that she might go away into another world. She had felt so doomed up here in the eternal snow, as if there were no beyond.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Now suddenly, as by a miracle she remembered that away beyond, below her, lay the dark fruitful earth, that towards the south there were stretches of land dark with orange trees and cypress, grey with olives, that ilex trees lifted wonderful plumy tufts in shadow against a blue sky. Miracle of miracles!â€”this utterly silent, frozen world of the mountain-tops was not universal! One might leave it and have done with it. One might go away.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She wanted to realise the miracle at once. She wanted at this instant to have done with the snow-world, the terrible, static ice-built mountain tops. She wanted to see the dark earth, to smell its earthy fecundity, to see the patient wintry vegetation, to feel the sunshine touch a response in the buds.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She went back gladly to the house, full of hope. Birkin was reading, lying in bed.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Rupert,'' she said, bursting in on him. ''I want to go away.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He looked up at her slowly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you?'' he replied mildly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She sat by him und put her arms round his neck. It surprised her that he was so little surprised.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Don''t YOU?'' she asked troubled.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I hadn''t thought about it,'' he said. ''But I''m sure I do.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She sat up, suddenly erect.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I hate it,'' she said. ''I hate the snow, and the unnaturalness of it, the unnatural light it throws on everybody, the ghastly glamour, the unnatural feelings it makes everybody have.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He lay still and laughed, meditating.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Well,'' he said, ''we can go awayâ€”we can go tomorrow. We''ll go tomorrow to Verona, and find Romeo and Juliet, and sit in the amphitheatreâ€”shall we?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Suddenly she hid her face against his shoulder with perplexity and shyness. He lay so untrammelled.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' she said softly, filled with relief. She felt her soul had new wings, now he was so uncaring. ''I shall love to be Romeo and Juliet,'' she said. ''My love!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Though a fearfully cold wind blows in Verona,'' he said, ''from out of the Alps. We shall have the smell of the snow in our noses.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She sat up and looked at him.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Are you glad to go?'' she asked, troubled.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â His eyes were inscrutable and laughing. She hid her face against his neck, clinging close to him, pleading:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Don''t laugh at meâ€”don''t laugh at me.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Why how''s that?'' he laughed, putting his arms round her.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Because I don''t want to be laughed at,'' she whispered.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He laughed more, as he kissed her delicate, finely perfumed hair.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you love me?'' she whispered, in wild seriousness.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' he answered, laughing.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Suddenly she lifted her mouth to be kissed. Her lips were taut and quivering and strenuous, his were soft, deep and delicate. He waited a few moments in the kiss. Then a shade of sadness went over his soul.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Your mouth is so hard,'' he said, in faint reproach.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And yours is so soft and nice,'' she said gladly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But why do you always grip your lips?'' he asked, regretful.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Never mind,'' she said swiftly. ''It is my way.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â She knew he loved her; she was sure of him. Yet she could not let go a certain hold over herself, she could not bear him to question her. She gave herself up in delight to being loved by him. She knew that, in spite of his joy when she abandoned herself, he was a little bit saddened too. She could give herself up to his activity. But she could not be herself, she DARED not come forth quite nakedly to his nakedness, abandoning all adjustment, lapsing in pure faith with him. She abandoned herself to HIM, or she took hold of him and gathered her joy of him. And she enjoyed him fully. But they were never QUITE together, at the same moment, one was always a little left out. Nevertheless she was glad in hope, glorious and free, full of life and liberty. And he was still and soft and patient, for the time.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â They made their preparations to leave the next day. First they went to Gudrun''s room, where she and Gerald were just dressed ready for the evening indoors.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Prune,'' said Ursula, ''I think we shall go away tomorrow. I can''t stand the snow any more. It hurts my skin and my soul.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Does it really hurt your soul, Ursula?'' asked Gudrun, in some surprise. ''I can believe quite it hurts your skinâ€”it is TERRIBLE. But I thought it was ADMIRABLE for the soul.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No, not for mine. It just injures it,'' said Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Really!'' cried Gudrun.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There was a silence in the room. And Ursula and Birkin could feel that Gudrun and Gerald were relieved by their going.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You will go south?'' said Gerald, a little ring of uneasiness in his voice.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' said Birkin, turning away. There was a queer, indefinable hostility between the two men, lately. Birkin was on the whole dim and indifferent, drifting along in a dim, easy flow, unnoticing and patient, since he came abroad, whilst Gerald on the other hand, was intense and gripped into white light, agonistes. The two men revoked one another.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald and Gudrun were very kind to the two who were departing, solicitous for their welfare as if they were two children. Gudrun came to Ursula''s bedroom with three pairs of the coloured stockings for which she was notorious, and she threw them on the bed. But these were thick silk stockings, vermilion, cornflower blue, and grey, bought in Paris. The grey ones were knitted, seamless and heavy. Ursula was in raptures. She knew Gudrun must be feeling VERY loving, to give away such treasures.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I can''t take them from you, Prune,'' she cried. ''I can''t possibly deprive you of themâ€”the jewels.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''AREN''T they jewels!'' cried Gudrun, eyeing her gifts with an envious eye. ''AREN''T they real lambs!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, you MUST keep them,'' said Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I don''t WANT them, I''ve got three more pairs. I WANT you to keep themâ€”I want you to have them. They''re yours, thereâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And with trembling, excited hands she put the coveted stockings under Ursula''s pillow.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''One gets the greatest joy of all out of really lovely stockings,'' said Ursula.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''One does,'' replied Gudrun; ''the greatest joy of all.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And she sat down in the chair. It was evident she had come for a last talk. Ursula, not knowing what she wanted, waited in silence.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you FEEL, Ursula,'' Gudrun began, rather sceptically, that you are going-away-for-ever, never-to-return, sort of thing?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, we shall come back,'' said Ursula. ''It isn''t a question of train-journeys.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, I know. But spiritually, so to speak, you are going away from us all?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula quivered.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I don''t know a bit what is going to happen,'' she said. ''I only know we are going somewhere.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun waited.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And you are glad?'' she asked.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula meditated for a moment.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I believe I am VERY glad,'' she replied.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But Gudrun read the unconscious brightness on her sister''s face, rather than the uncertain tones of her speech.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But don''t you think you''ll WANT the old connection with the worldâ€”father and the rest of us, and all that it means, England and the world of thoughtâ€”don''t you think you''ll NEED that, really to make a world?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula was silent, trying to imagine.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I think,'' she said at length, involuntarily, ''that Rupert is rightâ€”one wants a new space to be in, and one falls away from the old.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun watched her sister with impassive face and steady eyes.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''One wants a new space to be in, I quite agree,'' she said. ''But I think that a new world is a development from this world, and that to isolate oneself with one other person, isn''t to find a new world at all, but only to secure oneself in one''s illusions.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula looked out of the window. In her soul she began to wrestle, and she was frightened. She was always frightened of words, because she knew that mere word-force could always make her believe what she did not believe.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Perhaps,'' she said, full of mistrust, of herself and everybody. ''But,'' she added, ''I do think that one can''t have anything new whilst one cares for the oldâ€”do you know what I mean?â€”even fighting the old is belonging to it. I know, one is tempted to stop with the world, just to fight it. But then it isn''t worth it.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun considered herself.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' she said. ''In a way, one is of the world if one lives in it. But isn''t it really an illusion to think you can get out of it? After all, a cottage in the Abruzzi, or wherever it may be, isn''t a new world. No, the only thing to do with the world, is to see it through.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula looked away. She was so frightened of argument.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But there CAN be something else, can''t there?'' she said. ''One can see it through in one''s soul, long enough before it sees itself through in actuality. And then, when one has seen one''s soul, one is something else.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''CAN one see it through in one''s soul?'' asked Gudrun. ''If you mean that you can see to the end of what will happen, I don''t agree. I really can''t agree. And anyhow, you can''t suddenly fly off on to a new planet, because you think you can see to the end of this.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ursula suddenly straightened herself.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes,'' she said. ''Yesâ€”one knows. One has no more connections here. One has a sort of other self, that belongs to a new planet, not to this. You''ve got to hop off.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun reflected for a few moments. Then a smile of ridicule, almost of contempt, came over her face.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''And what will happen when you find yourself in space?'' she cried in derision. ''After all, the great ideas of the world are the same there. You above everybody can''t get away from the fact that love, for instance, is the supreme thing, in space as well as on earth.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No,'' said Ursula, ''it isn''t. Love is too human and little. I believe in something inhuman, of which love is only a little part. I believe what we must fulfil comes out of the unknown to us, and it is something infinitely more than love. It isn''t so merely HUMAN.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun looked at Ursula with steady, balancing eyes. She admired and despised her sister so much, both! Then, suddenly she averted her face, saying coldly, uglily:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Well, I''ve got no further than love, yet.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Over Ursula''s mind flashed the thought: ''Because you never HAVE loved, you can''t get beyond it.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gudrun rose, came over to Ursula and put her arm round her neck.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Go and find your new world, dear,'' she said, her voice clanging with false benignity. ''After all, the happiest voyage is the quest of Rupert''s Blessed Isles.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Her arm rested round Ursula''s neck, her fingers on Ursula''s cheek for a few moments. Ursula was supremely uncomfortable meanwhile. There was an insult in Gudrun''s protective patronage that was really too hurting. Feeling her sister''s resistance, Gudrun drew awkwardly away, turned over the pillow, and disclosed the stockings again.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Haâ€”ha!'' she laughed, rather hollowly. ''How we do talk indeedâ€”new worlds and oldâ€”!''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And they passed to the familiar worldly subjects.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald and Birkin had walked on ahead, waiting for the sledge to overtake them, conveying the departing guests.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''How much longer will you stay here?'' asked Birkin, glancing up at Gerald''s very red, almost blank face.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, I can''t say,'' Gerald replied. ''Till we get tired of it.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''You''re not afraid of the snow melting first?'' asked Birkin.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald laughed.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Does it melt?'' he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Things are all right with you then?'' said Birkin.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald screwed up his eyes a little.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''All right?'' he said. ''I never know what those common words mean. All right and all wrong, don''t they become synonymous, somewhere?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Yes, I suppose. How about going back?'' asked Birkin.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh, I don''t know. We may never get back. I don''t look before and after,'' said Gerald.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''NOR pine for what is not,'' said Birkin.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gerald looked into the distance, with the small-pupilled, abstract eyes of a hawk.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''No. There''s something final about this. And Gudrun seems like the end, to me. I don''t knowâ€”but she seems so soft, her skin like silk, her arms heavy and soft. And it withers my consciousness, somehow, it burns the pith of my mind.'' He went on a few paces, staring ahead, his eyes fixed, looking like a mask used in ghastly religions of the barbarians. ''It blasts your soul''s eye,'' he said, ''and leaves you sightless. Yet you WANT to be sightless, you WANT to be blasted, you don''t want it any different.''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â He was speaking as if in a trance, verbal and blank. Then suddenly he braced himself up with a kind of rhapsody, and looked at Birkin with vindictive, cowed eyes, saying:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Do you know what it is to suffer when you are with a woman? She''s so beautiful, so perfect, you find her SO GOOD, it tears you like a silk, and every stroke and bit cuts hotâ€”ha, that perfection, when you blast yourself, you blast yourself! And thenâ€”'' he stopped on the snow and suddenly opened his clenched handsâ€”''it''s nothingâ€”your brain might have gone charred as ragsâ€”andâ€”'' he looked round into the air with a queer histrionic movement ''it''s blastingâ€”you understand what I meanâ€”it is a great experience, something finalâ€”and thenâ€”you''re shrivelled as if struck by electricity.'' He walked on in silence. It seemed like bragging, but like a man in extremity bragging truthfully.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Of course,'' he resumed, ''I wouldn''t NOT have had it! It''s a complete experience. And she''s a wonderful woman. Butâ€”how I hate her somewhere! It''s curiousâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Birkin looked at him, at his strange, scarcely conscious face. Gerald seemed blank before his own words.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''But you''ve had enough now?'' said Birkin. ''You have had your experience. Why work on an old wound?''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Oh,'' said Gerald, ''I don''t know. It''s not finishedâ€”''

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And the two walked on.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''I''ve loved you, as well as Gudrun, don''t forget,'' said Birkin bitterly. Gerald looked at him strangely, abstractedly.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ''Have you?'' he said, with icy scepticism. ''Or do you think you have?'' He was hardly responsible for what he said.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The sledge came. Gudrun dismounted and they all made their farewell. They wanted to go apart, all of them. Birkin took his place, and the sledge drove away leaving Gudrun and Gerald standing on the snow, waving. Something froze Birkin''s heart, seeing them standing there in the isolation of the snow, growing smaller and more isolated.

Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin'' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now, she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that''s your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I''m guessin'' it''s wiser to exit with dude

â€“ Slava KPSS
â€“ Yeeea. Slavik, what''s up with this interesting merch of yours?
â€“ That''s Antihype merch. You''re gonna see the fall of Tower of Babel, like on Bruegel''s painting. I''ve got 56 types of weed in me, just like in my yeger''s flask. Yeeeeah man
â€“ Strange question, but what''s your opponent''s name?
â€“ Tick-tock-boom, tiki-tiki-ti-punk, steampunk, bitch! That''s how we''re gonna call him
â€“ Thoughts on this event? Your opinion on the battle of different battle leagues? Predictions on the result?
â€“ My only prediction is 4:0, like in the match between SKA-Energia and Spartak that''s gonna happen soon, it''s gonna be kinda same. Damn, it''s SKA-Khabarovsk now, sorry
â€“ Aight, guess you gotta chill a bit. Good luck on the battle!
â€“Â Antihype!

â€“ Salute! Introduce yourself
â€“ My name is Miron
â€“ Who''s your opponent?
â€“ My opponent is my old @%#$rider
â€“ Why did you decide to accept to battle with him?
â€“ Well, I didn''t accept it, I invited him. He''s a true battle MC, I never battled against those. They''re people who can''t really write songs, they''re always battling, so they become sort of local gods, so I''m interested, just for the sport of it, to see how I''ll perform against him
â€“ You''re a successful man, why do you need battles?
â€“ I''m doing it just for the sport of it, as I said. I started with battles, I''m not stopping any time soon. Just to prove to myself, another check mark, another check mark. Or no check mark, I''m ready for whatever

I''m here just for fun, really, just to mock a weak one
You crawled out of your mother while my Baban diss was playing in background
Accusatory pathos is zilch against the father
Those rhymes were written by drunk and high Kripl
You''re funny, way too tall, and you''re honestly clumsy
Your body reminds me of a pregnant heron
Unproportional, like your hype and your contribution into rap
Not A Cloud in Trousers, you''re just a trend, like cloud rap
Here only for couple seasons. Where''s your choker? Why?
You don''t wanna go out of vogue, like Volchok clothes
The person who pushed you forward a year ago with just one tweet
Now will flush you away in the toilet
What an Irony of Fate, fascinating, isn''t it?
Before battling someone, I have to praise him
To prove all of you that he can be the victor
Before crushing an MC, you have to love him in the beginning
I did great
I knew that Gotham needed a Joker
Who''s against me. Full moon rising
The town cheers for him, a new character in the deck
But I''m the director myself, I created you, I filmed you
I''m Bruce Wayne and Christopher Nolan together
All roles are prepared already, yours is written from the beginning to the end
I needed an enemy? Voila!
You''re a theatrical villain, your mustache fell off
Yeah, you''re a Joker, but up my sleeve. Shave your ace
And get ready, Arkham gives you a free lodging
And my @%#$ knows what''s up with all these cuts you have
[Slava KPSS interrupts him]
I agree

I''m the master of promotion
You found the casting and started pulling off your underwear:
â€“ Are you really the producer?
â€“ Yes, I really am
I''ll make you, son. You''re my !#!$ slave
Call me Fadeev Maxim
That''s a fat promotion
I''m taking you off a cage by pulling the strings
How does it feel when you know that you''re a marionette in the Jew''s hands?
You hyped for a year using my name
Okay, I don''t mind the hype
It''s just sad that you''re a miserable lackey
Couldn''t go up yourself, still a nobody at the bottom
Your "fans" are angry that I don''t release a new mixtape
Your eyes tell me that you wrote text for this battle back in December
Because the school of Slovo...

[Restorator screams]
IS THE WEAKEST LEAGUE IN THE COUNTRY

Yeah, we''re about SlovoSPB. You got owned by RBL
I''d get bodied by Zabe, Teeraps, and Piem, if they tried
But the rest, all of you are mediocrities
30 weeks for the text, and then fake, pretend you just started writing
Been writing it in December, January, February, March, April
May, June, July. And thought, the text is ok, Tech N9ne, boo!
I wrote mine in a week, plus-minus two days
I''m afraid of you 30 times less than you''re afraid of me
But don''t be afraid. What do you have at stake, Olimpiyskiy?
Dozens of paid Petersburg people, who all depend on the battle
Who''ll lose everything in case of a loss?
But an MC should be ashamed if he''s been preparing for months
Memorized your lines? Good job!
[Slava KPSS replies]
Nope

The person frazzled by Ramzan

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Bodybag!

[Oxxxymiron repeats]
Bodybag!

When I invited him to battle, he was all about those ideals
But in a year you lost your way, Slava
What can a person, who repeated every mistake after me, in just one year, really tell me?
I''m nine years in this game, you''re just helping me, slug
You, like myself, have changed? But the sales are still the same
You, like myself, have apologized? But no one even hit you!

Real talk, real talk

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Isn''t it @%#!ing wonderful, guys?

You, like myself, became a businessman, but still sound like a commissioner
You, like myself, were against that rap herd, but still recording with all of them
We''re all hypocrites, because we change every day
What once was true, may change one day, perhaps even completely
But your worldview changed in a record time!
Bam! And you''re on the stage
Bam! And you''re recording with LSP
Bam! And you''re releasing cheap clothes at Vitya SD''s
The Flow is writing reviews, all good and real
But in a year underground cat became exactly what he had rebuked
And your idea, bled like Lyalya
You''re throwing stones while sitting in a glass house
Was in the basement, but the attic got flooded
Searching for walls by running From Castle to Castle
But you build them on sand
And your showy kindergarten in your secondhand lyrics
Is obvious to everyone, believe me, it was boring to write a text against you
Even Johnyboy was more of a true guy, in comparison with you
Together, you should open a hookah-barber-sushi-smoothie-vape bar
Antihype? That''s Vagabund, that''s Vagabund
For people in backwoods who use Windows 3 with a dial up modem, while not knowing how to enable cookies
"We need more members", Booker taught you this way
You need to open an escort agency "Booking muzhchin"
And it''s all giggles, but the truth hurts
He''ll talk a lot, but he can''t say much
You can dig up all the dirt and my dead friends
Can wash all my bones, along with dirty linen, cook your black kisel
Can find out with whom, how many times, and in what poses I had %!@
But if you do this, you''re done, too
Look, he has a girlfriend called Sasha Discotheque

[Slava KPSS interrupts him]
Not anymore, man, you''re too late

[Oxxymiron replies]
It doesn''t matter

Imagine how many punchlines about her I could come up with!
Or about ST''s wife, it''s so cute
But I came here to battle you, not her
Not your parents, not your mother''s bank account
Not your promiscuous %!@ual behavior, Fallen doesn''t count (here he is!) Fallen doesn''t count

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Fallen! Fallen MC!

And he, who uses rumors about relatives, just shows who''s the father on this arena
Think about it, lad, all you''ll see is you getting promoted in MDK
How many millions I made last year â€“ that''s what Forbes and RBK are arguing about
Obviously, there''s a bunch of rumors about me
I even stopped bringing groupies, what if they make a hole in a condom?
And then they will leak our photos to OK magazine, that''s the dark side of being famous...
...just like his trip to Phuket half a year ago
Whoops!

[Slava KPSS puzzled]
What? Are you high? Are you high?

[Voice in background]
True story!

I have little birds too, and unlike yours they''ve got clip microphones on them
He thinks, "I hope he didn''t find out about Golden Resort!"
Bro, there''s no shame in it, there''s no shame in it!
Let''s put it this way. For a short time, and it was rather innocent
But he had a friend known as "the dancer"
Not really a masseur, not really a make-up artist, not really an exotic dancer
But that''s not the problem, the problem was that he basically looked like a typical trans
Give me this folder!
Here. Now, I''d like anyone, who actually saw Karelin on Resort, to come here
Oh well, looks like there are none today, but a little bit more and y''all would believe me!
Battles with real facts! Battles with real facts!

[Voices in background]
Genius! Bravo! We need to think about this one

Battles with real facts â€“ the gift for liars
The truth? Nah, just know how to present it properly

[Slava KPSS replies]
Yep

If you''re gonna dig up all the dirt, searching in the garbage
You will represent not Slovo, but Podslushano Khabarovsk

[Slava KPSS cheers]
Yeeeaa. Nice!

So, basically, you have two lines of attack:
Either blame me for something you''re even worse at, well, that''s dumb
Or, like Cynics, be a dog, and come up with something rotten about me, $#%! yourself right here
Gnojnyj, your words are pure air
You look like E.T., but landed in Grozny, as it seems
It''s easy to get in here swiftly, but as easy to get shredded
You had a decent year, it''s not too late to leave
Time!

[Voices in background]
Slava, @%#! him up! Slava, @%#! him up!

[Round 1: Slava KPSS]
Slava KPSS and Oxxxy, the new punk wave
And everyone was waiting for a performance of the King and the Jester
Well, @%#! this!
I declare, you''re dead as a creator and you don''t deserve to be honored as a cult rap singer
I don''t accept your accomplishments, so when I spit my rhymes I remind you of your father
Let''s talk about your album, !#!$yze it in Lavrentiy Beria''s cold-blooded manner
You performed poorly in your Gryffindor, if there''s something Russians are good at, then it''s destroying the empires
Everyone waited four years for it, he tried his best to intrigue them
And what he came up with? Recorded an audiobook
A trivial dystopia, by the way
That''s the level of discourse of Jahmal and Loik
With a plot that any stupid %$#@@ could come up with
Your rap is cheap literature in paperback
It''s just a bunch of the most boring cliches in history
Original plot: tragic love story in a dystopia
No one @%#!ing came up with something like this before, right?
Neither Orwell nor Zamyatin
It''s a pop motif everyone @%#!ing fed up with already
But you said it yourself to Afisha, "It''s not about how good an idea is, it''s only about its survivability"
Well, if your music is a brand, then why don''t I choose Gucci?
It''s commercial too, just like your allegedly breakthrough album with the smart punchlines with a dash at the end
A used condom can make some noise too, if it ends up in a female monastery
I remember that @%#!ing feeling when your fans started playing your album loudly in my house
It felt like I''m a honey dipper who got his annual salary paid in $#%!
Well, look at this little @%#! who emerged as a king
Loved to drop names so much that he even came up with his own ones
So conceptual because you got tired of the craft
You ran out of ideas even before you started writing
Used to be "against everybody", now he''s kinda our guy
The album is so crap that it got praised by Noize, you get it?

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Right in the heart! Right in the heart!

You said he was a graphomaniac to the core
And he praises Gorgorod, and not, let''s say, your first mixtape
It''s not a coincidence, Ogorod is a piece of grinded out $#%!
I don''t see 11 tracks, I see 11 sentences for raping myself
You come up with new characters like a @%#!ing cripple sculpts in clay with his stump hands
It''s hard to mix up you and a poet, like a bag of @%#$s and a spinner
"A slim print of a shoulder", teachers, what a shame!
You couldn''t see this in Pasternak''s work, it''s simply illiteracy!
A print of a slim shoulder! @%#!, writing isn''t your strongest suit
You come up with not punchlines, but silliness like "handball world record"
The @%#! is this? It''s on your album
The @%#! is this, idiot? Where''s the work on the word?
Where are the unexpected meanings, man?
It sounds like a misstep in porno:
You thought if people lick your ass, you can $#%! on the tongue
And when you get a diarrhea, you know what will be the ugliest?
That all your trips into the toilet are connected with each other, even your $#%! is conceptual!
@%#! all the dumb politicians and all those greedy bankers
The worst are you, the creators of this indecent subjectivity
Where "third-tier remix of Yesenin" or top-tier one of Aldous Huxley
Have the social approval. But I don''t @%#!ing care about Jewish fairy tales
I don''t listen to Gorgorod, don''t read Torah, and don''t hang around Echo of Moscow
Weird, they love the bald ones in the Right Sector, but they would still @%#! you up

[Shouts to the crowd]
Hush! Hush!

For Brodsky-like graphomania, Yesenin-like $#%!-tier lyricism
Where are you walking the edge yourself? At the edge of a pool near a hotel?
@%#!, when you tell me that I''m not really a musician
And only live on some dubious hype
You''ll basically describe yourself
After all, Gorgorod is not even a good calque, not a napalm, but a bubble gum
You just $#%! a bunch of liberal cliches
But writing dystopias, what kind of a protest is that, dumbo?
Useless like police shooting a gay parade with rubber bullets
You didn''t spit from the barricades
And even your favorite Lamar said "@%#! Trump!"
But for you "@%#! up" is an open visors evening
Where you''re afraid to talk freely. And even He Is Not Dimon to You
Is braver in this aspect than your @%#!ing album
You''re like, "I''m not a politician, I''m an artist, I don''t write statements, I write tracks"

[Voice in background]
True story!

But like a politician you''re a populist, otherwise why would you get into all this?
You were rooting so @%#!ing much for Russia that you started nervously losing ganglia?
But when we had protests here, where you were? In England!
London, London, teach us how to live! How are we Rebuilding Russia without you?
You impose your dime novel as political satire
But don''t call them by names, it''s full of Jewish surnames
And we have a tradition in Russia, we don''t call the names when we talk about a rat in our own collective
Meanwhile I bring you the revolution, like back in the days, straight from Tushino
The wheels of this cart are spinning. The Futurists threw Pushkin from the steamship of modernity!
And you kept Oxxxy. Because he''s alive!
But he''s just a living proof of how anyone can run out of ink and become a nobody in four years
Spent your talent, not on the hop, but on dope and dust
Your Oxxxy is just an inflated figure, like a glass rooster
Time!


[Round 2: Oxxxymiron]
Yo. He said he didn''t listen to Gorgorod, but the spring will tell us who $#%! where
The whole your first round is a paraphrase of the track "Who You Became". Think about it

[Slava KPSS and Oxxxy]
â€“ Nope. Nope, it''s not
â€“ Yes, it is. Relisten it again, bro
â€“ Nope. I did listen to it

Anyway. Yo. Give me mic, start the cypher, let''s hype
Let''s offend mother and lie, steal and bite
Pour a tub of $#%! over the brothers, ghostwriter is found
Rhythm? @%#! it! On the battle, become more popular than aristocracy
So, stop it. Don''t compare us
Back in the day I was anti-, was breaking their moral grounds
So I could $#%! on an average man â€“ pioneer
I should have kept you as sperm on the bed
Since what was fresh back then, back in the years
Completely different now, unfortunately, unfunny stand-up
One thing is violating a tabu, turn the crowd inside out
Twist the listener with the power of words, eat their soul
And another thing is a conveyor of $#%!
No goals, only one idea: to get the most likes. Isn''t it true
That like Ernesto you wanted to get on TV?
It''s okay, I don''t judge. Even though your duplicity is kinda awful
Actually, whatever, he''s a swindler
Personally, I never performed on a corporate party
It''s hard to hear for me when people are chewing
Never was on radio, was on TV only once
Even though I get a lot of requests daily, like it''s PMs from lolis
Meanwhile, if you were me, you''d be singing in Golden Ogonyok right now
Saying "I''m here just to troll"
True, true story

[Slava KPSS replies]
Yes

To give you an idea, I didn''t record with Major Lazer for 15 millions
You''d suck a black #@$% for pocket change from a sponsor, like the writer Limonov

[Slava KPSS pointing at Oxxxy]
Smart guy

And they say, "Mirosha, you crazy!"
Nope, I just don''t like Major Lazer
They say, "you''re a dumbass"
But true fans know, I appreciate them, Oxxxytentacion
I have three X''s too, ayy
You''ll disappear, like my mixtape
A lot of doubts, Miron, ayy
Who likes %!#%@es in his mouth? Gay
You''ve got a new release? Ayy
You''ve got a hundredth release? Ayy
If your rap is rap, then my rap if you''re with me shout "ayy!"
Look, only SlovoSPB remained silent. WindbagsSPB
I will never visit you, like it''s a school of MVD
Underdogs of battle rap? Nah, you''re snobs without cash
Topical battle with Shurygina? It''s the bottom of SPB

[Slava KPSS asking]
What does it have to do with me?

Nah, I''m not even arguing, Versus is bull$#%! too
With such an energetic start, it became a nightmare in half a year

[Oxxxymiron to Restorator]
You thought I''d give you a line and will remain silent?
Yeah, we''re friends, but you $#%! on what we started together

[Slava KPSS talking to his friends in background]
Easy. Like I said, he talks about this $#%!

And that''s not a stab in the back, Sanya, remember with Jan
How many times did I explain it to you?
Versus used to be a place where we''d find the new talents
Now it''s a place where every mediocrity can get some quick dough
Where you can fall flat on your face, like Larin
A flock of blogger-fans will like these 5 minutes of fame anyway
Offbeat? Screw it! Reloads, reposts, BMW, BPM
Less rappers than sponsors. Circus!
What about rap-hagakure, the way of bushido?
I keep mumbling about the culture, like Redo bit me
"The old man is just envious of Khovan''s and Eldar''s success!", nah
It''s just that all your idols have the same ghostwriter from Fresh Blood
And it''s not a protest, I''m not hip-hop policeman
And when he doesn''t offend the dead, Khovan is a pretty good guy
But since all of your bloggers and comics are passing through battle rap
Let''s be honest and list all the writers

Easy, easy, real talk, real talk

But I believe, Versus will resurrect
And if it''s not Slovo, then it''s a bluff
Me and Sanya have a bunch of @%#! ups
But wounded lion is still a lion
While a healthy jackal remains a jackal
You thought I''m afraid of somebody?
Your jokes, punchlines, Zamay and Berserk?
Bro, I''ve seen much worse, I swear!
Console yourself that you''re still underground
And you''re still on top
But I''m like NTV, who wants all the ins and outs of SlovoSPB?
Well, listen what happened five years ago
There was no Versus, no Slovo, rap was shouting "dat''s what''s up!"
Andrey Mikheyev knew, that I''m following King of the Dot since 2008, and told that to Hyde
Krasnodar is on the line, we spoke through Skype for 3 hours
Hints, questions, how to write texts for battles
I remember how I explained them that I''m tired of freestyles
All the schemes, flips, who to stand correctly
And we both were sick with this $#%!
Well, that''s basically the whole story, how this project was born
I was there in the beginning, kiss the ring! Dat''s what''s up!
Since I was the consigliere of Don Anton, your godfather
Everyone who says "what?" doesn''t know the history
Anyway
So, don''t want to kiss the ring?
How predictable, he''s not an authority to you
You wanna organize your own battle-quartet

[Talks to Den Cheney]
But Cheney, stop this bull$#%!, you knew
I kept the neutrality, but you keep misleading everyone
You and Berserk didn''t just leave Hyde
Betraying father and the project
You secretly registered your rights for the project!
And I heard this story

Real talk, real talk in this bitch

First you secretly registered your right for the project
And I heard this story from you and PLC
You came up with a bunch of excuses, but I asked you straight:
If Hyde and PLC are really exploiting the weak, fascists
And you''re innocent victims, slaves of the franchise
Then why didn''t you create a new battle with a new name, but stole their name and registered it like rats?
And you know what he told me? True story:
"Eastern Roman Empire", remember?
We were sitting in front of 1703, Koryushka party, remember, remember!
"Eastern Roman Empire didn''t change their name when they separated from Roman"
Well, Deniska, you''re a bad boy, a radish
When I was partying with him, I kept my wallet really close
And thanks for the history class you read me generously
Unfortunately, pathos and demagoguery won''t help you, Denis
You abandoned the ship and stole a loose lifeboat in a hurry
Brought a crew of midgets, kept telling us bull$#%! for years
And you didn''t visit us to be friends, you hated us
Your tamed %!@#$ Stefan and a pocket Jew Edik
You''re forever in the shadow of your Big Brother
You''re a calque, even while drunk
You''re Restorator on minimal settings
You''re not Slovo, you''re not Versus, you''re a fake branch
Impostors, the whole logo is full of someone else''s achievements
Die, SlovoSPB!
You built a crypt, thought you could hide it from them
Your story, but sorry, bro, I''m gonna open up this abscess
There''s an alchemy formula, what''s on top is on the bottom too
If rats are controlling Slovo, what do you expect from the servants?
And in you, like in a microcosm, Slovo truly reflects
All your envious intrusiveness, along with your stung pride
What''s there left for Gnojnyj?
Keep trolling and be always against something
Except you, sir, when trolling, you don''t fight, you echo me

[Talks to Zamay]
If it''s cool, Zamay, alright, continue
Continue offending me in vain, bro

Bull$#%!ting about hype with Antihype you can''t hide the lack of meaning behind the predicate
And I dunno why Jubilee found the feigned couldn''t-care-less attitude
Dunno why Ernesto battled you like a you''re an angry communist
You''re simply empty, absolutely empty, nothing behind your soul, I''m sorry for it
You were spitting rhymes about monkeys, but you''re a primate too
But you''re a primacy of the form over the content
Diss after diss, after release, after mixtape, after remix. Your incontinence is so huge
That you''ve got diarrhea without $#%!, it''s simply water. Instead of your ass you use your two hemispheres
You''re not a byaka, you''re way too fragile
Achilles, turtle, heel
Soaking up, like a sponge
But I''m gonna squeeze you, like a rag
You''re cheap copy of Versus
You are a funny cosplay of me
Waiting for the new intro, where Cheney riding a Lexus around 1702 bar
It''s hard to forget me, impossible to hurt my feelings, all your tries are off the mark
Miss Russia, Oksana Fyodorova, Sonya is here as an ugly friend
I''m not a partymaker, I''m a bodybagger
Antifaker, original Russian hater
My mother is Jewish, my father is like Drake''s father
Bitch, I''m Ice Kid like Grime Kid and @%#!in'' bagging
Canning, mother@%#!ing, Town, E16, baby!
Slava, it''s time to go to bed, collect the stickers
But no matter what you won''t understand how to write cool tracks
Since the only thing you''re good at is battling and creating remakes
And me? I''m the Universal Soldier, the clubs won''t be sold out
While you *spits* keep removing my saliva from your forehead
You dolt, we''re family here, Obi and Drago are both friends
We''re like The Three Musketeers from Remarque''s and Dumas'' novel
How do you say it? *pow pow* In your face with RPG
Your praised legion? Plasterboard and particle board
Y''all are just loudmouths with teen overblown ego
Versus is something SlovoSPB can never be!
That''s it, that''s the whole story with chronicle
And my dead homie aka Nikolay Gumilyov will help me with the epilogue
That''s about you:

In olden days, when above the new world
God inclined his face, then
The sun was halted with a word
A word could destroy cities

And the eagle would not flap its wings
The terrified stars would cling to the moon
When, like a pink flame
The word floated in the heavens

But you have forgotten the word alone
Is numinous among earthly struggles
And in the Gospel According to John
It is said that the word is God

You have chosen to limit it
To the boring limits of nature
And, like bees in a deserted hive
Dead words smell bad

Versus!

[Oxxxymiron talks while brooming]
â€“ I don''t mind
â€“ Could clean the sneakers too, while you''re at it
â€“ Nah, bro

[Round 2: Slava KPSS]
So well-mannered, huh?

Thought you invited me to battle. That''s a brave deed as for a Jew
And then I realized, that''s not bravery, it''s just a common sense:
If you''re fighting, you die faster
You reanimated my career, hyped it up to eleven!
One day I''m gonna write a book called "The tweet that changed my life"
But my grandpa is Johnyboy and he taught me, "don''t believe the Jew
Cuz if he''s throwing you a ring buoy then your career is sinking"
So no remorse! KPSS is in this skirmish
The only sober like it''s a drunk fight
Remember the communist from the forum tore you a new one?
I''m not Baban''s biter, I''m mimicking the maniac
Are you really an opponent for me, though, with punchlines about "this big"?
Imma @%#! you up with whatever I have lying around
Here''s a shelf full of your @%#! ups, I''m picking a random one
You considered Guf to be $#%!, now you kinda admire him
"The burry talent", huh?
You''d be like "@%#! it" towards the Russian rap, but it''s a hard thing to do when you''re castrated
Either you''re a trimmer or it took you years to see Guf''s talent, go figure
You represent this cheap $#%! called the Plastic World
And if the judges look at him lovingly then consider him a winner already
Knowing where the noise is coming from is your superhero ability
Oxxxy vane, he changes his direction even when someone is blowing a tailwind
Yeah, this soldier doesn''t hold a defense
@%#!, even a pathologist gets under the skin more frequently than him
Can''t say a bad word about anyone nowadays
According to the contract, you remain toothless, like Alexander Ovechkin
We''re on the war here, yeah
And you ran away, leaving behind the outpost
You just stand aside and watch
Like those Germans who allowed the Holocaust
You say you changed the direction?
Nah, you only changed where you''re rowing towards
Stopped @%#!ing others'' mothers, he''s an adult now, what''s next?
A battle every year, so what, where are the punchlines?
Your bars in battles are an ugly bride
Wanna marry her off, but she got nothing to ask the price for
And how a person can stand behind something if there''s nothing to stand behind?
It''s painful to watch your attempts
You get the battle contexts just as good as the dude in "Dad reacts to Versus" videos
Check it @%#!ing yourself, fantastic Miron''s punchlines without himself lose their shine
"You''re not the creator of golems, but on this photo you''re like a potter"!

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Top punchline!

And that''s not the only one. The one about @%#!ing "awl in the ass", "the bad energetics" one, "Gulkin''s @%#$" one
If someone else used those, they''d send him to RBL

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
â€“ RBL respect!
â€“ @%#! them

But not you, nah, since you came up with this obscene counting-out rhyme
What''s next? On this battle you gonna fart in front of a lighter?
Or the one about pithecanthropus, bro
That punchline was really @%#!ing dumb
I''m not Oxxxymiron, but
You guys perform like a lubricant on a @%#$head
Exactly the same, absolutely no additional information
On his next album he''s gonna rhyme, "We give you everything, like a passport in UVD!"
Or about @%#!ing #%@!$#%! geolocation
#%@!$#%! geolocation, wonderful!
So you don''t believe in ZOG, but believe that a #%@!$#%! sends some information to a satellite?

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
It was a joke, idiot

And his texts are full of $#%! like this
Works perfectly ofc, since he serves it with an arrogant face of an expert
"My flow is a DDoS attack, we''ve got the remote access"!

[Oxxxymiron replies]
So-so punchline, yeah

Remote access, eh?
You $#%!ty scholar, we won''t get far in space with specialists like this
DDoS actually prevents the remote access!

[Oxxxymiron talks to his friend in the crowd]
Jan, I checked this punchline with you, why didn''t you tell me?

Or maybe "you''re speaking too fast, and I''m listening too slow"?
They even made merch based on this phrase, for the smartest ones
But what you might not know is that this phrase was first used in 2010 by Nonna Grishayeva in the TV show Big Difference

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Dunno who that is, sorry bro

Yeah? So either you stole it knowingly
Or your level, scum, is comedy cud from TV
So those who get it and who can''t stand the TV
Won''t notice the difference if "City under the sole" is playing there the whole day
But Miron doesn''t need punchlines, he''s an interesting dude either way
Today you''re watching battles without punchlines, and tomorrow it''s gonna be porn without girls

[Oxxxymiron talks to his friends behind]
My texts don''t have any punchlines? I don''t get it

Personalities, personalities, personalities!
What are those @%#!ing personalities?
They believe that I was drinking $@#% from a boot, and that you dated Sonya Grese

[Oxxxymiron shouts]
Never!

And that your mouth has so much protein in it that you can bake the full tray of meringue
Since battles are the after-truth territory
It doesn''t matter which fact is truthful
So what''s up with the personalities, @%#!ing retard, it''s all about the number of punchlines
I''ve got a full pack of equivalent bars, like it''s Fix Price
If the king dies, the coffin should be king-size
Oh, you need a cupboard to keep the skeletons of those you''ve battled with?
I''ve got an interesting fact for you: I need 4 of those, since I''ve battled 16 times
And they put you against the wall with John
I guess out of this firing squad I''m the only one who has live ammunition?
They buried themselves, but you pretended like you''re helping them:
You motivated ST, threw a ring buoy to John, was lecturing Kripl

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
You''re next, you''re next, you''re next. Let''s do this, let''s do this, let''s do this

[Slava KPSS shouts at the audience]
Silence! Shut the @%#! up, bitches!

Listen here, you @%#!ing piece of crap, you can seduce others with your sonnets
I''m not Finland for you, so don''t you, bitch, come to me with your pieces of advice
And stop talking about yourself. @%#!, I call you Dryomin
A battler is supposed to be a psychologist, and not act like he''s visiting one

[Oxxxymiron addresses the viewer]
Hah! Remember this

If you forget about the opponent while battling him
Then you''re probably jerking off near the toilet when you visit your girlfriend
And the she says, "Miron, let''s move to my place?"
And you reply, "I don''t wanna @%#! with you, I''m here to improve my results from the previous %!@!"
The father of battle rap in Russian, you produce some dubious stuff
Antihype is a social service, I take the parental rights away from you
You act like you''re fighting for improvement, but it''s all empty talk
You have never visited another battle league
How would you know if the culture is still alive if you don''t measure the pulse?
Make battle rap great again? You don''t even know that it''s dying, no new talented MCs
Raytraun is battling at Versus now. We''re doing the remakes of the old finals
In fact, we''re kicking around the dead genre
Battle rap is dead, there''s no underground
Meanwhile, mainstream is a shame, like Fresh Blood on blood
But if it''s gonna die while being filmed
I wanna be the gun shooting at Brandon Lee!

Oh, and I wanna pronounce the time of death: 17:03!
Time!

[Round 3: Oxxxymiron]
Have you noticed this? Third rounds always hit the hardest
MCs always put some intrigue into them
But I''m a nerd, so I''m gonna sacrifice it, screw it!
I wanna talk about books

[Talks to Slava KPSS]
â€“ You can take a nap in meanwhile
â€“ Gonna humiliate me now, for Jacques Genet?
â€“ Nah, nah, nah

There''s this great book called The Hero with a Thousand Faces
I bet it''s gonna sell well now
I read it back in Kiev this crazy spring
When I was deep in the solitude
The tongue left me, I was stuck
You don''t know what it is
Everyone was wondering: drinking or preparing a new release?
Meanwhile I was there, just sitting on a balcony
(Those rhymes are so-so, right?
But whatever, they''re true.)
That book returned me back to life
I realized that I''m still alive
And the same book inspired Lucas, back in the day, to write (Where''s Obi? Oh, there he is) Star Wars
The idea is simple: in all mythologies, in all religions, no matter how many
And in the base of any story there''s on motif:
Someone hears the voice from afar
He leaves the home alone
He takes the road out of the town
Goes straight into a forest full of nets
Finds some monsters on his way
He fights them, still alone
He''s not a hero yet, he''s afraid of everything
But he keeps going
Eventually, he finds the lair
It will be hard, but he''ll make it
He''ll kill the dragon, get back to home
But he won''t be the same person he left
He''ll sleep a bit, no doubt
And then will go out again
All the comic books are based on this
The TV shows, the layers of culture
The drug trips, the dystopias, the fairy tales, the fables, the sculptures, and the dreams
To the point that if you compare Egypt myths and Banditskiy Peterburg
You''ll the the path of one hero under the disguise of these two
The path of the hero, killing the monsters
Collecting the treasures, building pagan temples
He''s not a hero because he''s ripped and he''s a warrior
But because it can''t be any other way
I remember the first battles in Russia
People thought you had to throw thousands @%#$s at the opponent
Then they started the deconstruction
Everyone would take the enemy apart
But behind all this kitchen psychology
Lies the collective unconscious

[Slava KPSS replies]
Oh yeah?

And behind any, even everyday one
Demonstration of negativity between two different people
You can see the ancient motif, collision of archetypes
The heroes, the dragons, they''re still here
Even if the battle is in office between a stapler and a hole puncher
And the heroes are similar to the dragons, people mix them up, but wait
There''s a fundamental difference between two
The dragon doesn''t have his own way, doesn''t have his own idea, no ideology
His role is to be an enemy. He''s chilling in his lair, breathing the smoke with fire
Why doesn''t, for example, Joker have his own movie?
Batman has one, Catwoman, Batman and Robin, but not him
Why is there no game where you''re playing as a mushroom, jumping on Super Mario?
And if there was one, it would be a joke. Millions wouldn''t be playing it
You get it. My !#!$ysis is rather simple
Gnojnyj, you''re just one more level, but not the final boss
The hero isn''t afraid to say I have the flaws, I''m vulnerable
That''s why people will see themselves in him
They won''t see anything in you
You''re a snake, you''re afraid of me and yourself
The only chance you have is to joke away, while mocking
You''re a slippery bastard, can''t catch you
Except it''s not a feature, it''s a bug, man
(Speaking of a programmer)
Because sarcasm is a shell, an armor, scales
But where are you, tovarisch?
I spit with the open visor, friends
Therefore you will lose
Maybe it''s just the way it goes or the karma is just $#%!ty
But you only played the antagonist''s role
And that''s the tragedy of Slava Mashnov, Karelin, et cetera
You are not an anti-hero, you are not a hero even
Zero empathy towards you
And crowd won''t go after you
For them, you''re just another person to follow in Instagram
You have no path, you used mine
But forgot that mine was sincere
Battle rap, black humor, and grime: where''s Gnojnyj behind mockery and anonymity?
There''s none, or he disappeared
You copied everything, even my gesture
Mister postmodernist, you are a compost, but $#%!-ist
All there''s left for you is to be an MC on parties
(@%#! that, you don''t have to make noise for that)
Oh, and maybe someone has noticed it
But my rounds have no mat in them
"How''s that?", will ask me Gotham. "You''re the author of that one quote."
It''s simple: I''m battling against a shell-shocked, really bland rat
While obscene language is the crowning jewel of the great Russian language
Okay?
And let''s say that today, perhaps, you will even defeat me

[Slava KPSS replies]
I will

I will get back to touring
You will get back to trolling me

[Slava KPSS replies]
Yep. That''s fantastic!
Let''s applaud the poet!

One hour caliphs, leaders for a moment
Look, ready to conquer the Olympus, while bragging about it
What?
My cake with candles is lit afar
I''m so old that "Black Star" for me is Talib Kweli and Mos Def

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Yeaaah, that''s good stuff

And some voice is whispering:
"Drop this rap $#%!
Keep your trail clean
Before you end up degrading like brostep"
But the bunch of faces are blinded by the opposite light
Screeching, tears, underwear, we are a boy band
And you? You''re momma''s armchair critic
Listen, EeOneGuy
As Stalin once said:
"If you''re criticizing something, then suggest something else!"
You gonna act like a fool, act recklessly
Doesn''t matter, you''re still in my rap coordinate system
If, one day, you come up with a different style
Because it''s shameful to live by someone else''s paradigm when you''re 27
Then you will be on your own way, you''ll be the protagonist of the narrative
Until then, you''re what an ass came up with
Slava, Slava, you''re jaunty and sweet
But take my organ out of your throat
You were a rather tall punching bag
I used to prepare myself for the battle with Dizaster!
Time!

[Voice from the crowd]
Slava, you''re just a marionette!

[Round 3: Slava KPSS]
You''re so @%#!ing narcissistic, bro. "I''m grime!"
But if you google "grime", you''ll see my video from Slovo
That''s how you promote grime those four long years
You''re angry at me, because I call my bull$#%! "grime"?
You''re so dumb, you don''t even get the joke, moron
I stole the dearest from you, like it''s kidnapping
Because of me, grime in Russia is now rap battles with fast flow

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Is that your opinion?

Think I do this out of pity or because I wanna become famous?
I''m just laughing at you, you @%#!ing bald female midget
And I''m okay with a status of Vkontakte-artist
While you don''t get it, like a postmodernist any money in a pawnbroker''s shop
You migrated to Russia, but your hair are in panic
Ran away to Europe, like Syrian refugees
What''s next on the menu? Let''s talk about your Aryan schnoz
If it decides to leave, you know, like in Gogol''s story
It will go straight to Israel, to get the dough
Since your nostril looks like the cave Christ was born in
@%#!, only you can refrain from battling for a year
Tatu dedicated their "Malchik Gay" to you
I need The Easy Way to Stop Battling, since I @%#! a bunch of battlers like you every day
There''s a red dwarf in front of me, like I see Betelgeuse in the telescope
Hail you down with a bunch of punchlines, call it flow Mayweather
Bodybag, since I play battle rap frequently
My number of frags is off the charts, like I''m playing laser tag
@%#! everybody!
Keep talking about nihilism, but you can tell a denier since he''s shining from the inside out
"@%#! mainstream!"... shouted this counterculturist during his battle against Dunya
Now, using myself as an example, he explained why this way leads nowhere
"It''s miserable and awful, but why do I need this boiling $#%!?
I declined even Evening Urgant''s offer!"
Declined, yeah? You''re a Jew, remember?
Here you''re so true, but behind the curtain...
You declined the commercial offers to get all the fattest ones!

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Real talk, real talk
What about you, though?

He went to Urgant, after all, but was outrageously... neat there
Wore a shirt with a dumb print
Damn, you showed them corporate pigs!
Take that, @%#!ing cultural terror! Weren''t ready?
If they invite him to Dom-2, he''ll wear socks with sandals
@%#! off with your Showroom, stick your stock market data up your ass
I roll you into a shawarma and shove it in Khovan''s throat!
Enough!
You meshed so well with the image of the saint buffoon, you''ll feel a mild pain when I start tearing it off, along with the flesh
"My work with Reebok is to create something new and not grab the cash from the fans"
They take some old sneakers, put the Oxxxy logo on them, and then double the price!
@%#!, that''s what you were fighting for?
Well, you''re out of luck
You were a hungry MC, ate others, and became spoiled
It''s really pitiful
To see a lonely and sad 30-years old man who drags a fangirl into his dressing room
@%#! it, I dedicate this to all the girls:

You like the Mayor''s song so much
Don''t know about postmodern rap
You go wild when you hear "Devochka-Pizdets" and go on Oxxxy''s concert
But remember: even the prince can be a scumbag
And if he sees a princess in you, he''s like a dragon
Can catch you and @%#! you in the cave!
Yeah, in your very own little cave
So what about the battle with Schokk?
"He was like a brother to me, I''ll never make a show out of it!"
Well, that''s honorable, to not $#%! on those you were together with
But then you quarrelled with LSP and acted like Buzova at Lobnoe mesto
You released an hour-long video to throw $#%! at your former artist
Therefore that''s exactly what your current artists can expect to happen later
Makes sense, right?
And at the end he said, "If we have to, we can solve this the other ways. It''s not 2013, we''re different now!"
Really? Are you proud that you''re so brutal now you can beat LSP up?
Maybe you''ll @%#!ing kick Dzharakhov in his face too?
Or will leak a %!@ tape to fans?
God, no trans is trying so @%#!ing hard to look masculine
Pretending to be a cowboy? Stop this $#%!
Only in Brokeback Mountain you could be the Red-ass Chief
You''re spitting rhymes, you aren''t robbing a bank
If you see a bunch of rods around you, then you''re walking in a park
You forgot what the hatred is
In a beef, you''re like a disabled person in a wheelchair
"The scum assumed my kindness was a weakness". @%#!, that sounds like it''s from the Twitter of some %$#@@ from the block!
Called Sasha a toastmaster, meanwhile you performed your verse from the battle on Serebro''s corporate party
A toastmaster!
True story!

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
That was not a corporate party. I can prove it easily

More contests await! Turn off the lights
Whoever loses goes to Butyrka prison? Sure
After that situation with Chechnya, I''m the best at throwing a pencil into a bottle!
And you still live off that pretentious culture creator''s $#%!, huh?
No self-irony, no mockery
"Porchy, Akela has missed!", when you''re $@#%ing past urinal
You narcissistic moron, that''s not theatrical stage for you
But you spent more time in front of The Mirror than Andrei Tarkovsky
All those songs that are only about yourself
How you, alone, with a bag of polonium, for 6 years straight
"Didn''t try to appeal to those who despised you at first"?
Dubious $#%!
Act in Zhigan''s film? That''s a really eloquent symptom
Apparently it''s the only person in the world who has both Down and Stockholm syndromes!
Like general Vlasov, you are a piece of $#%! and a traitor
When you received the news from Berlin, you changed your side
Threw your friend away faster than the gangster his shawarma
I wouldn''t let you to have my back, like you''re a drunken tattoo master

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
You were fifteen

And all for the stadiums and the loud crowds?
Olimpiyskiy will be a great coffin for an ego of your size
And when I think, "Stop! That can''t be it! Oxxxymiron is way smarter than that"
I remember that you like Lyokha Med
That you praise Mozee Montana and dream about performing in Olimpiyskiy

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Yeah. Things, things

@%#!, you''re as picky about your tastes as a young %$#@@ at a house party!
How angry he was when he couldn''t sign Bumble Beezy
He chose... "Punchlines and Rhymes"
Your booking has a problem, Beezy is the Russian Lil Peep
But MCs aren''t memes for you to steal them from "RiP"
@%#!, wanna earn money with booking? It''s easier to earn money with Booker
Your shots are flat like it''s a platformer shooter game
Rem Digga was rhyming about Donbass, people went into trenches after him
And the only person who did anything after you is Urgant, who drew a @%#$ on his neck

[Slava KPSS shouts at the crowd cheering him]
Shush! Shush! Shush!

You didn''t live near the verbal ore in a mine
But you''re so @%#!ing pretentious, like you were in the same school with Putin
"Only forward! Only the progress!"
But what kind of progress? Towards the Western sound?
Any newbie can make beats like yours nowadays
Towards quality? Well, we heard your tracks
You even admitted yourself they were mixed in a slapdash manner
So, what''s up, stadium rapper? Where are you going?
You don''t cut the window to the West, you''re the Rat-catcher of Hamelin
You bring everyone to the bottom along with you
Like all of your new school. I''ve heard plenty of this stuff
If you wanna do like them, just be a McDonald''s franchisee
If there is good kid, m.A.A.d city already, why the @%#! do I need Gorgorod in my player?
Solving creativity challenges someone has already solved
Is like reusing a teabag
Yeah, you can do it, but it''s not the same. Shameful stuff for poor rappers
Who lack any new ideas. You are not Kendrick Lamar in Russia
In your whole career there was nothing except for @%#!ing self-reflection
"Me, me, me", all the stuff you recorded is about your own figure
You talk so @%#!ing much about culture, but have you even tried giving it a careful thought?
No, you have not. Even in our $#%!ty song about vape we''ve said way more
All your rap is about nothing, because it''s about Oxxxy

So, @%#! you and @%#! Versus, with its submissive crowd!
I would rather die a @%#!ing noname than become famous and end up being like you!

I guess maybe some little problems could arise
(There are always a few)
If anything happened and we couldn''t be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad
(Devastating)
Because this is very good
(And that would be good)
That would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that

[Verse 1: Wale]
Tryna keep it low
Keep ''em all on that need to know
Tell everybody that we''re just friends
But to be honest that platonic ##%$''s for TV shows
Same place, we''re with different folks
Case closed if they crack the code
Is it me, or is you cold?
Cause the feelings you ain''t showin'' pokin'' out your clothes
Go put a sweater on or get a room
Forbidden fruit, swimmin'' in your juice
Lot of ways I can get to you
But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo

It was never going to be the project we hoped forâ€”after all, the mixtape came together in just 6 days. Thatâ€™s the kind of pace at which Future regularly operates. Drake? Not so much: â€œIt''s tough to see someone do four, five songs in one night and not try to match it.â€ The result was a hit-and-run snapshot of strip-club rap at its absolute pinnacle. The unrestrained joy of "Jumpman" juxtaposed with the lights-on sadness of "Plastic Bag" doesnâ€™t get any more Magic City. Neither artist was in album mode, but the temptation to label WATTBA as a throwaway project would be unwise. The substance lies in the process, and the result is more enjoyable than 95 percent of music released in 2015. That''s really all that matters in the end. â€” Theonlydjorkaeff18. Meek Mill - Dreams Worth More Than Money
Meek Millâ€™s sophomore album came with an abundance of prepackaged drama and anticipation. Three years after his debut album and subsequent incarceration, Meek finally delivered a record ordained and ready for the streets he roamed as a nappy-braided youngin. From symphonic tracks like â€œLord Knowsâ€ with Tory Lanez, to flamboyant whip bangers like â€œJump Out The Faceâ€ and "R.I.C.O." assisted by Drake â€” Dreams Worth More Than Money showcases Meek''s versatility and storytelling repertoire. His alliance with Nicki Minaj adds a touch of love to a gangsta''s paradise, the self-proclaimed Queen of Rap appearing on â€œAll Eyes On Youâ€ and â€œBad For You.â€ This record showed listeners that with the right combination of braggadocio, drama, and emotional depth, even a street album can reach the ears and minds of the world. â€” Slickk17. Logic - The Incredible True Story

Logicâ€™s sophomore album is a sci-fi epic. Semi-frequent interludes dubbed "scenes" are interwoven throughout the album''s hour-long runtime, separating some of Logicâ€™s best songs to date. The concept piece, composed during a one-night writing session, chronicles the journey of two astronauts looking for a hospitable planet dubbed "Paradise." While on their journey, the pair passes the time by listening to Logicâ€™s The Incredible True Story in the year 2115. Behind the 18 tracks stand 9 producers, not including Logic who makes 10, and a sole feature verse from Logic''s long-time friend and RattPack member Big Lenbo on fan favorite â€œYoung Jesus.â€ With the project''s stellar production and lyrical content, itâ€™s easy to see why he achieved his goal of 100,000 units sold in the first week. "This is the album that changed everything." â€” Skhills16. Mac Miller - GO:OD AM
GO:OD AM is a departure from the sad, drugged-out Mac we were used to. He felt motivated and confident from the get-go and it''s clear Miller wanted this album to reflect that change.  The Mac from K.I.D.S joined forces with the introspective nature of Watching Movies With The Sound Off, finding balance on the LP. The result: his strongest project to date. The MC from Pittsburgh held his own on every song, with clever punchlines like: â€œYou put the ho in honest baby, so complicatedâ€ on the standout â€œ100 Grandkidsâ€. He often outshines guests like Ab-Soul, Little Dragon, Miguel, and Chief Keef over production by Tyler the Creator, DJ Dahi, and ID Labs. GO:OD AM is another solid display from Miller. â€” YahwehSolomon15. Rae Sremmurd - SremmlifeIn time when a full-time job seems like 60 hours a week, stepping back and having fun is underrated. Thatâ€™s where Rae Sremmurdâ€™s debut album SremmLife comes in. While the duo donâ€™t tackle social issues like Kendrick Lamar or have the intricacies of Pusha T, they make hit records. Even Push admitted their brilliance: â€œThey make songs that I canâ€™tâ€ he acknowledged on Hot 97. And heâ€™s right. Slim Jxmmy and Swae Lee are hip hopâ€™s new dynamic duo, full of chemistry and swag, strutting their stuff over Mike WiLL Made-It bangers. In a project filled with lead singles, the stars aligned with three charting on the Billboard Top 100 and two, â€œNo Flex Zoneâ€ and â€œNo Typeâ€ became instant hits. Hit up your friends, crack open some bottles and let Rae Sremmurd be the soundtrack to your holiday season. â€” MvdS14. Young Thug - Barter 6Just when you thought Kanye West was the most polarizing artist in popular culture, along came Young Thug in 2013. Though many disregard Thugger as a weird and wacky singer, by Thug standards, Barter 6 is articulate and clear. Song structure takes center stage as his melodic voice dances over Wheezy & London on Da Track production. Accompanied by Cash Money boss Birdman on the standout â€œConstantly Hating,"  Thugger slows things down from his usual all-over the place delivery, making sure his haters understand every single word. Solo highlights include â€œCheckâ€ and â€œHalftime,â€ with the latter featuring several flow changes as Thugger switches between rapping and singing effortlessly. Despite the initial Tha Carter VI controversy, Thugger delivered an exciting preview to his proper full length debut Hi-Tunes slated for a 2016 release. â€” Michael Heal13. Jay Rock - 90059The long-awaited follow up to Jay Rockâ€™s 2011â€™s Follow Me Home finally arrived this year, and it didnâ€™t disappoint. The ''90s inspired, action-packed album fits 11 blockbuster tracks into 45 minutes and one zip code. 90059''s street philosophy is evident on tracks like â€œGumboâ€ and â€œMoney Trees Deuce,â€ while Rockâ€™s TDE brethren join him under the Black Hippy moniker on posse cut â€œVice City.â€ Lyrics and perspective are Jayâ€™s fortes and he brings both in abundance on this record. The intro track, â€œNecessaryâ€ paints a vivid picture:The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill
When you live in America, either kill or be killedâ€” Vuk Aleksic12. Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment - SurfDespite hopes this would be a solo Chance The Rapper project, The Social Experiment''s Donnie Trumpet took the helm on the collaborative Surf. This paid dividendsâ€”the free album was downloaded 618,000 times via iTunes in its first week. Sporting a star-studded tracklist filled with high-profile names like Big Sean, J. Cole, Erykah Badu and Busta Rhymes, highlights include â€œSunday Candy," an ode to Chanceâ€™s grandmother, as well â€œWanna Be Cool," a reminder that the coolest thing you can ever be is yourself. The band, comprised of Donnie, Chance, Peter Cottontale, Greg Landfair Jr. and Nate Fox, delivered a unique, genre-bending album that we canâ€™t get enough of. â€” MvdS11. Game - Documentary 2.5It can be tough pinpointing The Game''s personality on any one of his albums. His voice is often lost among the bevy of top-class talent at his disposal and while the Documentary 2 & 2.5 promised a similar outcome, with close to 20 top-drawer collaborators, Game''s concept and vision shines through on the second disc. One of his strongest ever vocal performance propels "From Adam" to another dimension, and his constant to-and-fro between gangland harmonizer and Blood soldier is a sight to behold. A shuddering verse on "Gang Bang Anyway" exposes the inner torment of a ghetto truth others are desperately afraid to touch. But Game has never dealt in the currency of shame, and this record is a stark reminder why his voice will remain important in hip-hop. â€” Theonlydjorkaeff10. Earl Sweatshirt - I Don''t Like #$!%, I Don''t Go OutsideI Don''t Like #$!%, I Don''t Go Outside clocks in at 29 minutes, just enough time for Earl Sweatshirt to retreat into the depths of his mind and unleash an LP packed full of raw lyricism: â€œI don''t act hard, I''m a hard act to follow, $@@$# / Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen" he raps on standout â€œGrief." His accession in the rap game is a common theme throughout the album, while other topics range from a break-up to outgrowing his parental home. With the exception of "Off Top," Earl produced the whole album (as moniker randomblackdude) and only four rappers are featured artists. His mood changes may be swift, but Earl''s self-realization and unbarred honesty deserve to be praised. â€” Sem Groeneweg9. Dr. Dre - Compton
Compton was unexpected. While we were all sitting around joking that Dre will never drop an album again after the decade-plus wait for Detox, the Doctor had been busy in the lab. Dre gave us a soundtrack, encapsulating a cinematic experience  perfectly timed with the release of the Straight Outta Compton film. You can hear it, Dre was inspired.

He drew from a plethora of experiences to meticulously craft the LP. The frightening â€œDeep Waterâ€ serves as a metaphor depicting Compton as a giant shark tank, while the soulful, melodic, deep-cut â€œAnimalsâ€ sees Anderson .Paak invite the listener sympathize with his message. Dre spared no expense with this album, assembling a crew of all-stars and rookies. Not only did he create an album that serves as an epic finale to his career, but also mapped out a legacy for the younger generation to follow. â€” Dr. Strange8. Joey Bada$$ - B4.DA.$$Always praised for his nostalgic aesthetic, Joey Bada$$ delivered another updated boom-bap project with B4.DA.$$. While the LP hasn''t made a bigger impact than 1999, Joey surprised fans with more personal lyrics and a great ear for beats. Big time producers like DJ Premier, Statik Selektah  and Hit-Boy blessed the young MC with dope drum breaks to spit over. Credit is due to someone who can ascend their passion. So while hip hopâ€™s chosen one hasn''t reached his full potential yet, B4.Da.$$ is a step in the right direction. â€” Sem Groeneweg7. Travis Scott - Rodeo

Despite the name of his 2014 prequel/mixtape Days Before Rodeo, Travi$ Scottâ€™s debut album arrived almost a year later. The enigmatic Scott emerged from the blogosphere in 2012 with almost industry plant level hype as a signee to both T.Iâ€™s Grand Hustle and Kanye Westâ€™s G.O.O.D Music. Over the next three years, Scottâ€™s various features, production credits, and mixtapes would shape the sound of Rodeo. This sound was crafted with the help of fellow Houstonian Mike Dean and this year''s Most Valuable Producer Metro Boomin to create a Mo City Yeezus. Dark, menacing synths and slab-rattling 808s on the opening track â€œPornographyâ€ set the tone for the album as Travis acts as a conduit, morphing potentially overshadowing features from Migos, The Weeknd, Justin Bieber and others into songs that make up an album that is uniquely La Flame. â€” BasedGator6. Future - DS2

On his third studio album, Futureâ€™s hallmark repetitive, pounding sound was replaced by agile and varied raps over sweeping, addictive productions. It both silenced skeptics and galvanized Futureâ€™s fanbase, cementing his position at the center of the rap game and the top of the charts. From trap bangers like â€œWhere Ya Atâ€ and â€œBlow a Bagâ€ to the emotional storytelling of â€œKno the Meaningâ€ and half-lidded-gem â€œThe Percocet & Stripper Joint,â€ thereâ€™s a ton of variety, but no dull moments. Lead single and highlight â€œ$@!% Up Some Commasâ€ doesnâ€™t even show up until track 18 on the deluxe edition, but you donâ€™t find yourself waiting for it to arrive.

A lot of the talk around Future this year focused on his impressive output: four full-length projects, two of which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. The fact is, Futureâ€™s been flooding the market for most of his career: He put out the same number of projects (including the original Dirty Sprite) in 2011. The difference this year was that the music demanded our undivided attention, and no project drove this point home as much as DS2, the shiniest purple diamond in the already-jewel-encrusted crown of 2015â€™s #futurehive. â€” Ezra Glenn5. Drake - If You''re Reading This it''s Too Late
Originally billed as a DJ Drama, mixtape, If Youâ€™re Reading This Itâ€™s Too Late became Drakeâ€™s reported escape from Cash Money Records. The 17-track â€œmixtapeâ€ proved to the world Drake is truly running this rap #$!%. With no prior announcement, the record managed to sell 495,000 copies â€” the best first week for a rap album in 2015. Executive produced by Drake, 40, and Boi-1da, Drizzy churned out hit after hit. Before anyone knew it, the whole project was on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart. From call-outs to his enemies on â€œEnergyâ€ to a long-awaited â€œ5AM In Toronto,â€ sequel, aptly titled â€œ6PM In New York,â€ Drake solidified his place as a hegemon in the rap state. Negative energy may have tried to take Drake down, but the 6 God was too busy running through the six with his woes in 2015. â€” Slickk4. Vince Staples - Summertime ''06Summer of 2006, the beginning of the end of everything I thought I knew. Youth was stolen from my city that Summer and Iâ€™m left alone to tell the story. â€”  Vince StaplesSummertime â€˜06 is a candid, vivid depiction of life in the streets. In just under an hour, Vince Staples immerses the listener in his world. From the brash and unapologetic â€œNorf Norfâ€ to the trap-inspired â€œSeÃ±oritaâ€ and the hopeful closer â€œLike It Is,â€ Staples delivers a range of cuts unlike most debut albums. Not only is he ambitious with sound, Vince is ambitious in content, releasing a double-disc project. Veteran super producer No I.D served as executive producer with appearances by Clams Casino and DJ Dahi. Summertime â€™06 is a fantastic debut LP, highlighting how far he''s come as an artist and more importantly, showcasing his potential to go ever further. â€” YahwehSolomon3. A$AP Rocky - At.Long.Last.A$AP

Although titled in the same breath, At.Long.Last.A$AP was a departure from the sound that made A$AP Rocky famous. With no Clams Casino behind the boards or spoon-fed hits like â€œ$@!%inâ€™ Problems,â€ Rocky delivered a sonic platter of dark, psychedelia-infused joints. Harlem''s own found solace in drugs after the passing of longtime friend and collaborator A$AP Yams, moving to London where he recorded the majority of the LP with newfound friend Joe Fox. Standout features include underground rapper Bones on the marauding â€œC%#!@ St.â€ and Kanye West on the soulful â€œJukebox Joints.â€ With impeccable production and little filler, A.L.L.A is still on repeat, six months after its release. â€” Michael Heal2. Lupe Fiasco - Lupe Fiasco - Tetsuo and YouthWhile Lupe Fiasco delivered his fifth studio album Tetsuo and Youth in January, the LP remains one of the best rap albums of 2015. Super Lupe delivered a seasonal concept; â€œSummerâ€ to â€œFall,â€ followed by â€œWinterâ€ and â€œSpring.â€ These â€œpalate cleansersâ€ serve as interludes between lush production and razor-sharp lyrics. From Lupeâ€™s eight-minute epic intro track, â€œMuralâ€ to Terrace Martinâ€™s saxophone solo on â€œBody of Workâ€ and Billy Blueâ€™s deep gruff on â€œChopper,â€ T&Y is as expansive in sound as it is lyrically deep. The Chi-Town MC even suggested listening to the LP backwards. Talk about Genius. Only Lupe could pull off something so intricate. â€” Michael Heal1. Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly
Kendrick Lamar''s To Pimp A Butterfly follows his rise to fame and subsequent survivor''s guilt after the release of good kid, m.A.A.d city.  K. Dot finds himself struggling through a war waging within his psyche, challenged by the dichotomy of his poignant insecurities and exceptional collectedness. Quite often, he finds himself entrapped in a self-constructed mausoleumâ€”and only here, does he begin to realize his own shortcomingsâ€”prompting self-reconciliation and the determination to apply what heâ€™s learnt to the rest of his community.  The standout â€œuâ€ delivers raw, visceral anger, while its counterpart â€œiâ€ promotes self-love and inner strength. Meanwhile, â€œAlrightâ€ serves humanity, inspiring those fighting against social injustices. To Pimp A Butterfly wasn''t just the album we wantedâ€”it''s the album we needed. â€” Eon2323Check out the 50 Best Rap Songs of 2015 here.19Embed', 1, N'None', 0, 100001, NULL, 100000, NULL, N'2024-03-20 00:00:00')

Made a wrong turn on the dark road on my way back
Crossed through a couple toll roads, had to pay tax

Ain''t too many people that I could trust
Keep to myself, ayy, spend this %!$% all on myself, uh
Where would I be without self? Uh
Look in the mirror like, "Boy, you look good"
Yeah, that''s right, had to pick up myself, uh (Pick up myself)

Don''t need nobody else
[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
Uh, you can be who you wanna be
But rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no faking me
''Cause gettin'' out this shell is real
I don''t know where I''m headed next, but
Man, I can''t even fake no more
Surrounded by lies and bull%!$%
@$!%@, I can''t even take no more
See, I woke up havin'' a bad day
And I gotta get the dollar any faster way
''Cause a @$!%@ growin'' up never had %!$%

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she''s so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin'' in college
That major that she majored in don''t make no money
But she won''t drop out, her parents''ll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain''t insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain''t picked a carurr
She like, "%#!$ it, I''ll just stay down hurr and do hair"
''Cause that''s enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, ''cause her baby daddy don''t really care
She''s so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn''t afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin'' with some issues that you can''t believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I''m so self-conscious
That''s why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can''t even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "!@#$!, you ain''t up on this"
And I can''t even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that''s clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin'' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss ''cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we''ll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a !@#$! in a coupe
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I''m tellin'' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon'' call now?

Come on, come on
I''m tellin'' you all, it all falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, "%#!$ the police," that''s how I treat ''em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can''t buy freedom
We''ll buy a lot of clothes, but we don''t really need ''em
Things we buy to cover up what''s inside
''Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That''s why shorty''s hollerin'', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain''t even gon'' act holier than thou''
''Cause %#!$ it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou''
Before I had a house and I''d do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin'' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it''s all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won''t get specific
I got a problem with spendin'' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I''m just the first to admit it
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C''mon, c''mon

I''m tellin'' you all, it all falls down

I mean, a !@%#$ did a lot of waiting

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon'' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it''s rubbin'' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I''m looking at her like, "This what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it''s summertime

And outta all the colors that''ll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don''t leave while you''re hot, that''s how Mase screwed up
Throwin'' $#@! around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That''s "Dior Homme," not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven''t said a word, haven''t said a word to me this evening

Lookin'' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin'' at my wrist, it''ll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, !@%#$''s shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord''s ladder
We still speedin'', running signs like they don''t matter, uh
Hater talkin'' never made me mad
Never that, not when I''m in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I''m a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin'', so it''s on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex'' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin'' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin'' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night''s over

We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we''re together
''Cause we''re scared to see each other with somebody else

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can''t stay to watch you
That''s the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can''t stay to hold you
That''s the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can''t stay to hear you
That''s the wrong thing to do
''Cause you''ll say you love me, and I''ll end up lying
And say, "I love you too"

[Refrain]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Something''s been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Oh, oh

Turn my name to "The kiDD," that''s a baby goat
Keep a Drac'' like I started up OVO
You can get a percent, but I want the most
Got a house with a lake, so I bought a boat
''Bout to switch up a play, that''s an audible
State-to-state, private jet with some model hoes
Had to run up more dollars than followers
Me and bae take the week off in Cabo
Life''s a gamble, I''m playin'' the lotto
I''m bettin'' it all ''cause I know that I got ''em
''Member me? I was drivin'' Impalas
We don''t beef, if it''s problems, we solve it
I remember that deuc? deuce revolv?r I bought for my partna
He died in a argument
They was hatin'', that''s why I''m way farther than ''em
''Member askin'' my mom where my father been at
Ain''t no talkin'', that fire what I''m tryna get at
#!!$%s cuffin'' these hoes that the crew done been had
Get them racks out the bank, put it right in the bag
Say he wouldn''t do that, but he would if he can
Hop out marchin'' with drums like we play in the band
I come straight out the mud, I ain''t been in no sand
Twenty-hour flight, had popped me a Xan
I got horny, almost @$%#ed on a fan
I had thinked about it, I can''t end up on Shade Room
Everything that I hit, I done paid for
She know what I can bring to the table
I can tell if it''s real by the label
We had TV, but we didn''t have cable
Now I''m richer than all of my neighbors

I''m tryna be here for mine, I can''t hold you
The Forgiatos twenty-four, this for Kobe
I shouldn''t have to say, you know that you owe me
You ain''t gotta search, you know that it''s on me

Bitch, I''m a D-boy, do it for T.Roy
I''m on you forever, that''s just word to V.Roy
I''m with the killas forever, the trenches is in me
The Grammys can''t change me for nothin''
I like the bitches who let me just offer them cash
You never gon'' ask me for nothin''
Never gon'' switch
Only time I ever switch is a Glock with a mother@$%#in'' button
Rappers be runnin'' back, tellin'' them bitches we hittin''
That''s why we don''t be tellin'' them nothin''

Way before Uzi was droppin'' the cross
We just a family, we never recruitin''
Clique full of killas, we choosin'' to shoot ''em
Someone tell Kanye and Kim to just stick to the script
And just tell ''em to free Larry Hoover
Me, I''m the voice, Baby, the hero
Trav like Michael Jackson, yeah
Been in it a minute, it''s crazy I''m winnin''
It only feel like I''ve been rappin'' a year
Let a #!!$% play with me, I''m ready
My bitch gettin'' rich off cosmetics
Life off, they done freed my daddy
Lights off, I couldn''t see my baby

Only way that they ever find peace (Yeah)
In that case, then I might need a priest (Yeah)
In the streets, gotta keep the belief
Not a wave, gotta keep you a sea (Sea)
Look for me, gotta keep you a fee (Fee)
Made a hundred and put it on gold (It''s lit)
Took the steppas and put ''em on roll (Straight up)
It''s a lotta them ridin'' and glidin'' and slidin'' that''s ready to snatch up your soul (Yeah)

Say the wrong thing, and wrong girls come runnin''
I''m paranoid that these girls want somethin'' from me
And it''s hard to make a dime go one-hunnid
And my dude freakin'' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
''Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin'' ''em if she''d wanna play games
We the Super Smash Brothers, but none of ''em you
I miss the %!$ where you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the art of choking''s
Only thing girls want when you in that smoke and light
[Chorus]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can''t speak
I can''t speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can''t speak
I can''t speak

[Verse 3]
So we''re done? This the real @#%!?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I''m a jerk, but your dude is a real #$!@
I read his posts on your wall, and I feel sick
He ain''t cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake !@#$! who blog in all caps
You couldn''t wait to date
I''m goin'' straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a !%#@ about the !@#$!s that you say you ate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I''m the best that you had, face it
J. and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money; then you burn me (Bernie), then you made off (Madoff)
She ain''t a killer, but she''d !%#@in'' blow your head off
I know he wonderin'', "What the !%#@ you hidin''?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden; ayo, !%#@ this

Now it''s #$@! you, I hate you, I''ll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it''s just words and they cut deep, but it''s our world, it''s just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn''t have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren''t so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
''Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We''ll probably end up robbin'' a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn''t that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, it''s my time, yeah, it''s on
He''s thinkin'' of signin'' me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should''ve known
''Cause you deserve it

It''s like ''06 in your backyard, I''m in love with Jade
And I''m still in love ''cause when it''s that real is when it doesn''t fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can''t come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn''t paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I''m your sister''s kid, but it still don''t explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new %@!%
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin'' going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I''m done acting
Now I''m more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I''d be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then you''d toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin'' that I don''t get arrested
Just another kid that''s going through life so worried that I won''t be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don''t know where I''d really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it
[Chorus]
Is this %@!% real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you''ve done, look what you''ve done
Look what you''ve done for me now, yeah

Hi Aubrey
I''m here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place

And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feeling about that

[Verse]
When opportunity meets preparation, I''m goin'' off like a detonation
I want it all, #%%@ a reparation
I do it all with no hesitation
#%%@ a punchline, I hit ''em with a combination like this #$%! was second nature
Layin'' down the law like this #$%! is legislature
Alligator jaws sayin'' ain''t nobody greater
I bow my head and do my numbers like it''s nothin'' major
Over time, I''ve been too humble, time to up the wager
Eight figures later, got my life all figured out
Gotta have tunnel vision if you wanna make it out
No fear of missin'' out
Ten thousand hours in, now it''s time to make it count
Investin'' ten percent of whatever in my bank account
Just in case we see bad weather, I hid a nice amount
You don''t really lose on stocks, never, ''less you take ''em out
Thinkin'' ''bout puttin'' some equity in another house
Thin line between brevity and longevity
One thing I never sacrifice is integrity
I ain''t nothin'' like these rappers, it''s a disparity
None of these %#@$$s is seein'' me, just for clarity
Rest in peace to STEEZ and Jun'', they put the battery inside my back
Now I''m back to leave a casualty and flee the scene casually
I ain''t even gotta aim, it''s all hip accuracy
Amen in Jesus name, my %#@$$s still gon'' blast for me
%#@$$s got audacity thinkin'' they could come after me
Runnin'' this #$%! on these tracks just like an athlete
Automatic classic when Joey get on a Statik beat
All my bars appreciate with time like a Patek Philippe
Ooh, I been thrivin''
New Presi'' on my wrist, call it Joe Biden
If I shoot, I never miss, I''ma keep firin''
The flow tyrant, I woke up and chose violence
Product of my environment walkin'' in my alignment
I''m the reason why %#@$$s talkin'' ''bout retirement
I''m the reason why %#@$$s often have been silent
Bow down to your highness, Brooklyn''s finest
This flow make ''em think there''s something wrong with they sinus
I came up from the underground and had to keep climbin''
I peep game like Jay, that''s why he didn''t sign us
Said keep the game at bay like the 49ers
47 #$%!, Steezy lookin'' down smilin''
Stars keep alignin'' so we gotta keep shinin''
I''m rare cut like a mother#%%@in'' pink diamond
The irony, I been the one you %#@$$s underminin'', %#@$$
This is somethin'' to remind ''em
Hidden in the rough, where you find ''em
Shine so bright that it just might blind ''em
Your favorite rappers wouldn''t be enough if you combined them %#@$$s

He saw the Lord''s call and got devout ''bout religion
Now this proud Christian mention pow-pow bidness
If I don''t drown out his sentence, I''ma roundhouse kick him
I keep telling myself he just a loudmouth bitching
But I''m a mild schizophrenic that ran out of my prescription
Now, I get to flipping, twitching out animalistic
Go wild up on a mission, prowling ''bout to get him
Forget about the crowd, you win shrouds, cloud his vision
And hop out like a lion when it''s pouncing on a victim
I''m gouging out his eyes, rip his nostrils off, sniff ''em
Reach in his mouth, snatch his tongue out, smile and then kick it
Start howling at the ceiling with a coyote resemblance
Jump down look around, start growling at the women
Foul malicious violence what you now about to witness
The scene gon'' look like a crime that a crocodile committed
911, start dialing up the digits
Humane Society and SWAT team gotta surround every entrance
It sound very vicious, but I lack a sane half a brain I actually may grab a blade and amputate ya'' hands and face I have a shank
Stab a place, burst your wound, gaps and space
Through ya'' body tissue, you now resemble a basket crate
I''m a basket case, needing some help please
I keep hearing bells ring and people that yell screams
These voices in my head, and the things that they tell me

Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Um—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let''s make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it''s Denny''s, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and $!@#@s swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This !$%@ unanimous for you, it''s damaging for you, I think
That %$@#! should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this mother$#%@er on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag

She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said, "Baby, spin that ''round and say the alphabet backwards"

Just ''cause he a nerd and you don''t know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a $!@#@ say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap''n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin'' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, "K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet

Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin'' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn''t let me on first base
A backpack $!@#@ with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got %$@#! from beats I did for $!@#@s more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn''t even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon'' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky''d and paid secretaries
For all my $!@#@s with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin'' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can''t fault ''em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain''t goin'' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin''
Of weak content and slow jammin''
But don''t worry, this one''s so jammin''
You know it, L.A., it''s so jammin''
I be thinkin'' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain''t I be drivin'', the problem is I be textin''
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was ''bout their friend that just died
Textin'' and drivin'' down Mulholland Drive
That''s why I''d rather take the 405
I be worried ''bout my daughter, I be worried ''bout Kim
But Saint is baby ''Ye, I ain''t worried ''bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I''m supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I''m too black, I''m too vocal, I''m too flagrant
Something smellin'' like !$%@, that''s the new fragrance
It''s just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I''m in my Yeezys, some days I''m in my Vans
If I knew y''all made plans, I wouldn''t have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn''t rap like this again
But the writer''s block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich $!@#@ problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don''t never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin'' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin'' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin'' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I''m workin'' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I''m workin'' on my house
Tell ''em party''s in here, we don''t need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good $#@$''ll do that
She keep pushin'' me back, good $#@$''ll do that
She push me back when the $#@$ go too deep
This good $#@$''ll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money!)
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love ''em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty mother$#%@er!

Don''t get me mad ''cause I don''t wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I''m livin'' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the lo'' and then that''s where I send it to
I was forgettin'' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that''s my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that''s my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin'' with
I gotta tell ''em "sorry," they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain''t deliverin'' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don''t try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that''s my bestie
They playin'' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin'', it''s gettin'' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can''t overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait ''til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can''t run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get ''em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin'' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get ''em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin'' wild if I feel like you press me

For when my kid, kid, kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

Pray for what folks and them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off His list, list, list

1. The Chicken Dance
This song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can''t help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding.

2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios
A major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat.

3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA
Light-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S.

4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion
The words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, "My heart will go on and OOOOOOON!" with Celine.

5. Don''t Stop Believin, by Journey
The ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey''s quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren''t even born then know the words. It''s a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song.

These time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they''ve got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones.

riage, first gave sign
Unto his contract; fire and air did shine,
As guilty of the match; and from the hill
The nymphs with shriekings do the region fill.
Here first began their bane; this day was ground
Of all their ills; for now, nor rumour''s sound,
Nor nice respect of state, moves Dido ought;
Her love no longer now by stealth is sought:
She calls this wedlock, and with that fair name
Covers her fault. Forthwith the bruit and fame,
Through all the greatest Lybian towns is gone;
Fame, a fleet evil, than which is swifter none,
That moving grows, and flying gathers strength,
Little at first, and fearful; but at length
She dares attempt the skies, and stalking proud
With feet on ground, her head doth pierce a cloud!
This child, our parent earth, stirr''d up with spite
Of all the gods, brought forth; and, as some write,
She was last sister of that giant race
That thought to scale Jove'' s court; right swift of pace,
And swifter far of wing; a monster vast,
And dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed
On her huge corps, so many waking eyes
Stick underneath; and, which may stranger rise
In the report, as many tongues she bears,
As many mouths, as many listening ears.
Nightly, in midst of all the heaven, she flies,
And through the earth''s dark shadow shrieking cries,
Nor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep;
By day on tops of houses she doth keep,
Or on high towers; and doth thence affright
Cities and towns of most conspicuous site:
As covetous she is of tales and lies,
As prodigal of truth: this monster—
Lup.
[within.] Come, follow me, assist me, second me! Where''! the
emperor?

1 Eques.
[within.] Sir, you must pardon us.

2 Eques.
[within.] Caesar is private now; you may not enter.

Tuc.
[within.] Not enter! Charge them upon their allegiance,
cropshin.

1 Eques.
[within.] We have a charge to the contrary, sir.

Lup.
[within.] I pronounce you all traitors, horrible traitors:
What! do you know my affairs? I have matter of danger and state to impart to Caesar.

Caes.
What noise is there? who''s that names Caesar?

Lup.
[within.] A friend to Caesar. One that, for Caesar''s good,
would speak with Caesar.
Caes.
Who is it? look, Cornelius.

1 Eques.
[within.] Asinius Lupus.

Caes.
O, bid the turbulent informer hence;
We have no vacant ear now, to receive
The unseason''d fruits of his officious tongue.

Mec.
You must avoid him there.

Lup.
[within.] I conjure thee, as thou art. Caesar, or respectest
thine own safety, or the safety of the state, Caesar, hear me,
speak with me, Caesar; ''tis no common business I come about, but
such, as being neglected, may concern the life of Caesar.

Caes.
The life of Caesar! Let him enter. Virgil, keep thy seat.
Enter Lupus, Tucca, and Lictors.

Eques.
[within.] Bear back, there: whither will you? keep back!
Tuc.
By thy leave, goodman usher: mend thy peruke; so.

Lup.
Lay hold on Horace there; and on Mecaenas, lictors. Romans,
offer no rescue, upon your allegiance: read, royal Caesar.
[Gives a paper.] I''ll tickle you, Satyr.

Tuc.
He will, Humours, he will; he will squeeze you, poet
puck-fist.

Lup.
I''ll lop you off for an unprofitable branch, you satirical
varlet.

Tuc.
Ay, and Epaminondas your patron here, with his flagon chain;
come, resign: [takes off Mecaenas'' chain,] though ''twere your great grandfather''s, the law has made it mine now, sir. Look to him, my party-coloured rascals; look to him.

Caes.
What is this, Asinius Lupus? I understand it not.

Lup.
Not understand it! A libel, Caesar; a dangerous, seditious
libel; a libel in picture.

Caes.
A libel!

Lup.
Ay, I found it in this Horace his study, in Mecaenas his
house, here; I challenge the penalty of the laws against them.

Tuc.
Ay, and remember to beg their land betimes; before some of
these hungry court-hounds scent it out.

Caes.
Shew it to Horace: ask him if he know it.

Lup.
Know it! his hand is at it, Caesar.

Caes.
Then ''tis no libel.

Hor.
It is the imperfect body of an emblem, Caesar, I began for
Mecaenas.

Lup.
An emblem! right: that''s Greek for a libel. Do but mark how
confident he is.

Hor.
A just man cannot fear, thou foolish tribune;
Not, though the malice of traducing tongues,
The open vastness of a tyrant''s ear,
The senseless rigour of the wrested laws,
Or the red eyes of strain''d authority,
Should, in a point, meet all to take his life:
His innocence is armour ''gainst all these.

Lup.
Innocence! O impudence! let me see, let me see! Is not here an
eagle! and is not that eagle meant by Caesar, ha? Does not Caesar
give the eagle? answer me; what sayest thou?

Tuc.
Hast thou any evasion, stinkard?

Lup.
Now he''s turn''d dumb. I''ll tickle you, Satyr.

Hor.
Pish: ha, ha!

Lup.
Dost thou pish me? Give me my long sword.

Hor.
With reverence to great Caesar, worthy Romans,
Observe but this ridiculous commenter;
The soul ''to my device was in this distich:
Thus oft, the base and ravenous multitude
Survive, to share the spoils of fortitude.
Which in this body I have figured here,
A vulture—

Lup.
A vulture! Ay, now, ''tis a vulture. O abominable! monstrous!
monstrous! has not your vulture a beak? has it not legs, and
talons, and wings, and feathers?

Tuc.
Touch him, old buskins.

Hor.
And therefore must it be an eagle?

Mec.
Respect him not, good Horace: say your device.

Hor.
A vulture and a wolf

Lup.
A wolf! good: that''s I; I am the wolf: my name''s Lupus; I am
meant by the wolf. On, on; a vulture and a wolf

Hor.
Preying upon the carcass of an ass—

Lup.
An ass! good still: that''s I too; I am the ass. You mean me by
the ass.

Mec.
Prithee, leave braying then.

Hor.
If you will needs take it, I cannot with modesty give it from
you.

Mec.
But, by that beast, the old Egyptians
Were wont to figure, in their hieroglyphics,
Patience, frugality, and fortitude;
For none of which we can suspect you, tribune.

Caes.
Who was it, Lupus, that inform''d you first, This should be
meant by us? Or was''t your comment?

Lup.
No, Caesar; a player gave me the first light of it indeed.

Tuc.
Ay, an honest sycophant-like slave, and a politician besides

Caes.
Where is that player?

Tuc.
He is without here.

Caes.
Call him in.

Tuc.
Call in the player there: master AEsop, call him.

Equites.
[within.] Player! where is the player? bear back: none but
the player enter.

[Enter AESOP, followed by CRISPINUS and DEMETRIUS.
Tuc.
Yes, this gentleman and his Achates must.

Cris.
Pray you, master usher:—we''ll stand close, here.

Tuc.
''Tis a gentleman of quality, this; though he be somewhat out
of clothes, I tell ye.—Come, AEsop, hast a bay-leaf in thy mouth?
Well said; be not out, stinkard. Thou shalt have a monopoly of
playing confirm''d to thee, and thy covey, under the emperor''s broad seal, for this service.

Caes.
Is this he?

Lup.
Ay, Caesar, this is he.

Caes.
Let him be whipped. Lictors, go take him hence.
And, Lupus, for your fierce credulity,
One fit him with a pair of larger ears:
''Tis Caesar''s doom, and must not be revoked.
We hate to have our court and peace disturb''d
With these quotidian clamours. See it done.

Lup.
Caesar! 

[Exeunt some of the Lictors, with Lupus and AEsop
Caes.
Gag him, [that] we may have his silence.

Virg.
Caesar hath done like Caesar. Fair and just
Is his award, against these brainless creatures.
''Tis not the wholesome sharp morality,
Or modest anger of a satiric spirit,
That hurts or wounds the body of the state;
But the sinister application
Of the malicious, ignorant, and base
Interpreter; who will distort, and strain
The general scope and purpose of an author
To his particular and private spleen.

Caes.
We know it, our dear Virgil, and esteem it
A most dishonest practice in that man,
Will seem too witty in another''s work.
What would Cornelius Gallus, and Tibullus?

[They whisper Caesar.
Tuc.
[to Mecaenas.] Nay, but as thou art a man, dost hear! a man
of worship and honourable: hold, here, take thy chain again.
Resume, mad Mecoenas. What! dost thou think I meant to have kept it, old boy? no: I did it but to fright thee, I, to try how thou
would''st take it. What! will I turn shark upon my friends, or my
friends'' friends? I scorn it with my three souls. Come, I love
bully Horace as well as thou dost, I: ''tis an honest hieroglyphic.
Give me thy wrist, Helicon. Dost thou think I''ll second e''er a
rhinoceros of them all, against thee, ha? or thy noble Hippocrene,
here? I''ll turn stager first, and be whipt too: dost thou see,
bully?

Caes.
You have your will of Caesar: use it, Romans.
Virgil shall be your praetor: and ourself
Will here sit by, spectator of your sports;
And think it no impeach of royalty.
Our ear is now too much profaned, grave Maro,
With these distastes, to take thy sacred lines;
Put up thy book, till both the time and we
Be fitted with more hallow''d circumstance
For the receiving of so divine a work.
Proceed with your design.

Mec. Gal. Tib.
Thanks to great Caesar.

Gal.
Tibullus, draw you the indictment then, whilst Horace arrests
them on the statute of Calumny. Mecaenas and I will take our
places here. Lictors, assist him.

Hor.
I am the worst accuser under heaven.

Gal.
Tut, you must do it; ''twill be noble mirth.

Hor.
I take no knowledge that they do malign me.

Tib.
Ay, but the world takes knowledge.

Hor.
Would the world knew
How heartily I wish a fool should hate me!

Tuc.
Body of Jupiter! what! will they arraign my brisk Poetaster
and his poor journeyman, ha? Would I were abroad skeldering for, a drachm, so I were out of this labyrinth again! I do feel myself
turn stinkard already: but I must set the best face I have upon''t
now.
[Aside.]—Well said, my divine, deft Horace, bring the !$@#!son detracting slaves to the bar, do; make them hold up their spread golls: I''ll give in evidence for thee, if thou wilt. Take courage, Crlspinus; would thy man had a clean band!

Cris.
What must we do, captain?

Tuc.
Thou shalt see anon: do not make division with thy legs so.

Caes.
What''s he. Horace?

Hor.
I only know him for a motion, Caesar.

Tuc.
I am one of thy commanders, Caesar; a man of service and
action: my name is Pantilius Tucca; I have served in thy wars
against Mark Antony, I.

Caes.
Do you know him, Cornelius?

Gal.
He''s one that hath had the mustering, or convoy of a company
now and then: I never noted him by any other employment.

Caes.
We will observe him better.

Tib.
Lictor, proclaim silence in the court.

Lict.
In the name of Caesar, silence!

Tib.
Let the parties, the accuser and the accused, present
themselves.

Lict.
The accuser and the accused, present yourselves in court.

Cris.
Dem. Here.

Virg.
Read the indictment.

Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your
hands. You are, before this time, jointly and severally indicted,
and here presently to be arraigned upon the statute of calumny, or
Lex Remmia, the one by the name of Rufus Laberius Crispinus, alias
Cri-spinus, poetaster and plagiary, the other by the name of
Demetrius Fannius, play-dresser and plagiary. That you (not having
the fear of Phoebus, or his shafts, before your eyes) contrary to
the peace of our liege lord, Augustus Caesar, his crown and
dignity, and against the form of a statute, in that case made and
provided, have moat ignorantly, foolishly, and, more like
yourselves, maliciously, gone about to deprave, and calumniate the
person and writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus, here present,
poet, and priest to the Muses, and to that end have mutually
conspired and plotted, at sundry times, as by several means, and in
sundry places, for the better accomplishing your base and envious
purpose, taxing him falsely, of self-love, arrogancy, impudence,
railing, filching by translation, etc. Of all which calumnies, and
every of them, in manner and form aforesaid, what answer you! Are you guilty, or not guilty?

Tuc.
Not guilty, say.

Cris.
Dem. Not guilty.

Tib.
How will you be tried?
[Aside to Crispinus.
Tuc.
By the Roman Gods, and the noblest Romans.

Cris.
Dem. By the Roman gods, and the noblest Romans.

Virg.
Here sits Mecaenas, and Cornelius Gallus, are you contented
to be tried by these?
[Aside.
Tuc.
Ay, so the noble captain may be joined with them in
commission, say.

Cris.
Dem. Ay, so the noble captain may be joined
with them in commission.

Virg.
What says the plaintiff?

Hor.
I am content.

Virg.
Captain, then take your place.

Tuc.
alas, my worshipful praetor! ''tis more of thy gentleness than
of my deserving, I wusse. But since it hath pleased the court to
make choice of my wisdom and gravity, come, my calumnious
varlets; let''s hear you talk for yourselves, now, an hour or two.
What can you say? Make a noise. Act, act!

Virg.
Stay, turn, and take an oath first. You shall swear,
By thunder-darting Jove, the king of gods,
And by the genius of Augustus Caesar;
By your own white and uncorrupted souls,
And the deep reverence of our Roman justice;
To judge this case, with truth and equity:
As bound by your religion, and your laws.
Now read the evidence: but first demand
Of either prisoner, if that writ be theirs.
[Gives him two papers.
Tib.
Shew this unto Crispinus. Is it yours?

Tuc.
Say, ay. [Aside.]—What! dost thou stand upon it, pimp! Do not
deny thine own Minerva, thy Pallas, the issue of thy brain.

Oris.
Yes it is mine.

Tib.
Shew that unto Demetrius. Is it yours?

Dem.
It is.

Tuc.
There''s a father will not deny his own bastard now, I warrant
thee.

Virg.
Read them aloud.

Tib.
Ramp up my genius, be not retrograde;
But boldly nominate a spade a spade
What, shall thy lubrical and glibbery muse
Live, as she were defunct, like punk in stews!

Tuc.
Excellent!

Alas! that were no modern consequence,
To have cothurnal buskins frighted hence.
No, teach thy Incubus to poetise;
And throw abroad thy spurious snotteries,
Upon that puft-up lump of balmy froth.

Tuc.
Ah, Ah!

Or clumsy chilblain''d judgment; that with oath
Magnificates his merit; and beapawls
The conscious time, with humorous foam and brawls,
As if his organons of sense would crack
The sinews of my patience. Break his back,
O poets all and some! for now we list
Of strenuous vengeance to clutch the fist.
CRISPINUS.

Tuc.
Ay, marry, this was written like a Hercules in poetry, now.

Caes.
Excellently well threaten''d!

Virg.
And as strangely worded, Caesar.

Caes.
We observe it.

Virg.
The other now.

Tuc.
This is a fellow of a good prodigal tongue too, this will do
well.

Tib.
Our Muse is in mind for th'' untrussing a poet,
I slip by his name, for most men do know it:
A critic, that all the world bescumbers
With satirical humours and lyrical numbers:

Tuc.
Art thou there, boy?

And for the most part, himself doth advance
With much self-love, and more arrogance.

Tuc.
Good again!

And, but that I would not be thought a prater,
I could tell you he were a translator.
I know the authors from whence he has stole,
And could trace him too, but that
I understand them not full and whole.

Tuc.
That line is broke loose from all his fellows: chain him up
shorter, do.

The best note I can give you to know him by,
Is, that he keeps gallants'' company;
Whom I could wish, in time should him fear,
Lest after they buy repentance too dear.
DEME. FANNIUS.

Tuc.
Well said! This carries palm with it.

Hor.
And why, thou motley gull, why should they fear!
When hast thou known us wrong or tax a friend?
I dare thy malice to betray it. Speak.
Now thou curl''st up, thou poor and nasty snake,
And shrink''st thy poisonous head into thy bosom:
Out, viper! thou that eat''st thy parents, hence!
Rather, such speckled creatures, as thyself,
Should be eschew''d, and shunn''d; such as will bite
And gnaw their absent friends, not cure their fame;
Catch at the loosest laughters, and affect
To be thought jesters; such as can devise
Things never seen, or head, t''impair men''s names,
And gratify their credulous adversaries;
Will carry tales, do basest offices,
Cherish divided fires, and still encrease
New flames, out of old embers; will reveal
Each secret that''s committed to their trust:
These be black slaves; Romans, take heed of these.

Tuc.
Thou twang''st right, little Horace: they be indeed a couple of
chap-fall''n curs. Come, we of the bench, let''s rise to the urn, and
condemn them quickly.

Virg.
Before you go together, worthy Romans,
We are to tender our opinion;
And give you those instructions, that may add
Unto your even judgment in the cause:
Which thus we do commence. First, you must know,
That where there is a true and perfect merit,
There can be no dejection; and the scorn
Of humble baseness, oftentimes so works
In a high soul, upon the grosser spirit,
That to his bleared and offended sense,
There seems a hideous fault blazed in the object;
When only the disease is in his eyes.
Here-hence it comes our Horace now stands tax''d
Of impudence, self-love, and arrogance,
By those who share no merit in themselves;
And therefore think his portion is as small.
For they, from their own guilt, assure their souls,
If they should confidently praise their works,
In them it would appear inflation:
Which, in a full and well digested man,
Cannot receive that foul abusive name,
But the fair title of erection.
And, for his true use of translating men,
It still hath been a work of as much palm,
In clearest judgments, as to invent or make,
His sharpness,—-that is most excusable;
As being forced out of a suffering virtue,
Oppressed with the license of the time:—-
And howsoever fools or jerking pedants,
Players, or suchlike buffoon barking wits,
May with their beggarly and barren trash
Tickle base vulgar ears, in their despite;
This, like Jove''s thunder, shall their pride control,
"The honest satire hath the happiest soul."

Now, Romans, you have heard our thoughts;
withdraw when you please.

Tib.
Remove the accused from the bar.

Tuc.
Who holds the urn to us, ha? Fear nothing, I''ll quit you, mine
honest pitiful stinkards; I''ll do''t.

Cris.
Captain, you shall eternally girt me to you, as I am
generous.

Tuc.
Go to.

Caes.
Tibullus, let there be a case of vizards privately provided;
we have found a subject to bestow them on.

Tib.
It shall be done, Caesar.

Caes.
Here be words, Horace, able to bastinado a man''s ears.

Hor. Ay.
Please it, great Caesar, I have pills about me,
Mixt with the whitest kind of hellebore,
Would give him a light vomit, that should purge
His brain and stomach of those tumorous heats:
Might I have leave to minister unto him.

Caes.
O, be his AEsculapius, gentle Horace!
You shall have leave, and he shall be your patient. Virgil,
Use your authority, command him forth.

Virg.
Caesar is careful of your health, Crispinus;
And hath himself chose a physician
To minister unto you: take his pills.

Hor.
They are somewhat bitter, sir, but very wholesome.
Take yet another; so: stand by, they''ll work anon.

Tib.
Romans, return to your several seats: lictors, bring forward
the urn; and set the accused to the bar.

Tuc.
Quickly, you !$@#!son egregious varlets; come forward. What!
shall we sit all day upon you? You make no more haste now, than a
beggar upon pattens; or a physician to a patient that has no money,
you pilchers.

Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your
hands. You have, according to the Roman custom, put yourselves upon trial to the urn, for divers and sundry calumnies, whereof you
have, before this time, been indicted, and are now presently
arraigned: prepare yourselves to hearken to the verdict of your
tryers. Caius Cilnius Mecaenas pronounceth you, by this
hand-writing, guilty. Cornelius Gallus, guilty. Pantilius Tucca—

Tuc.
Parcel-guilty, I.

Dem.
He means himself; for it was he indeed
Suborn''d us to the calumny.

Tuc.
I, you !$@#!son cantharides! was it I?

Dem.
I appeal to your conscience, captain.

Tib.
Then you confess it now?

Dem.
I do, and crave the mercy of the court.

Tib.
What saith Crispinus?

Cris.
O, the captain, the captain—-

Bor.
My physic begins to work with my patient, I see.

Virg.
Captain, stand forth and answer.

Tuc.
Hold thy peace, poet praetor: I appeal from thee to Caesar, I.
Do me right, royal Caesar.

Caes.
Marry, and I will, sir.—-Lictors, gag him; do.
And put a case of vizards o''er his head,
That he may look bifronted, as he speaks.

Tuc.
Gods and fiends! Caesar! thou wilt not, Caesar, wilt thou?
Away, you !$@#!son vultures; away. You think I am a dead corps now, because Caesar is disposed to jest with a man of mark, or so. Hold  your hook''d talons out of my flesh, you inhuman harpies. Go to, do''t. What! will the royal Augustus cast away a gentleman of
worship, a captain and a commander, for a couple of condemn''d
caitiff calumnious cargos?

Caes.
Dispatch, lictors.

Tuc. Caesar!
[The vizards are put upon him.
Caes.
Forward, Tibullus.

Virg.
Demand what cause they had to malign Horace.

Dem.
In troth, no great cause, not I, I must confess; but that he
kept better company, for the most part, than I; and that better men
loved him than loved me; and that his writings thrived better than
mine, and were better liked and graced: nothing else.

Virg.
Thus envious souls repine at others'' good.

Hor.
If this be all, faith, I forgive thee freely.
Envy me still, so long as Virgil loves me,
Gallus, Tibullus, and the best-best Caesar,
My dear Mecaenas; while these, with many more,
Whose names I wisely slip, shall think me worthy
Their honour''d and adored society,
And read and love, prove and applaud my poems;
I would not wish but such as you should spite them.

Cris.
O—!

Tib.
How now, Crispinus? C

Cris.
O, I am sick—!

Hor.
A bason, a bason, quickly; our physic works. Faint not, man.

Cris.
O———retrograde———reciprocal———incubus.

Caes.
What''s that, Horace?

Hor.
Retrograde, reciprocal, and incubus, are come up.

Gal.
Thanks be to Jupiter!

Cris.
O———glibbery———lubrical———defunct———O———!

Hor.
Well said; here''s some store.

Virg.
What are they?

Hor.
Glibbery, lubrical, and defunct.

Gal.
O, they came up easy.

Cris.
O———O———!

Tib.
What''s that?

Hor.
Nothing yet.

Cris.
Magnificate———

Mec.
Magnificate!  That came up somewhat hard.

Hor.
Ay. What cheer, Crispinus?

Cris.
O! I shall cast up my———spurious———snotteries———

Hor.
Good. Again.

Oris.
Chilblain''d———O———O———clumsie———

Hor.
That clumsie stuck terribly.

Mec.
What''s all that, Horace?

Hor.
Spurious, snotteries, chilblain''d, clumsie.

Tib.
O Jupiter!

Gal.
Who would have thought there should have been such a deal of
filth in a poet?

Cris.
O———balmy froth———

Caes.
What''s that?

Cris.
———Puffie———inflate———turgidious———-ventosity.

Hor.
Balmy, froth, puffie, inflate, turgidous, and ventosity are
come up.

Tib.
O terrible windy words.

Gal.
A sign of a windy brain.

Cris.
O———oblatrant———furibund———fatuate———strenuous—-

Hor.
Here''s a deal; oblatrant, furibund, fatuate, strenuous.

Caes.
Now all''s come up, I trow. What a tumult he had in his belly?

Hor.
No, there''s the often conscious damp behind still.

Cris.
O———conscious———damp.

Hor.
It is come up, thanks to Apollo and AEsculapius: another; you
were best take a pill more.

Cris.
O, no; O———O———O———O———O!

Hor.
Force yourself then a little with your finger.

Cris.
O———O———prorumped.

Tib.
Prorumped I What a noise it made! as if his spirit would have
prorumpt with it.

Cris.
O———O———O!

Virg.
Help him, it sticks strangely, whatever it is.

Cris.
O———clutcht

Hor.
Now it is come; clutcht.

Caes.
Clutcht!  it is well that''s come up; it had but a narrow
passage.

Cris.
O———!

Virg.
Again! hold him, hold his head there.

Cris.
Snarling gusts———quaking custard.

Hor.
How now, Crispinus?

Cris.
O———obstupefact.

Tib.
Nay, that are all we, I assure you.

Hor.
How do you feel yourself?

Cris.
Pretty and well, I thank you.

Virg.
These pills can but restore him for a time,
Not cure him quite of such a malady,
Caught by so many surfeits, which have fill''d
His blood and brain thus full of crudities:
''Tis necessary therefore he observe
A strict and wholesome diet. Look you take
Each morning of old Cato''s principles
A good draught next your heart; that walk upon,
Till it be well digested: then come home,
And taste a piece of Terence, suck his phrase
Instead of liquorice; and, at any hand,
Shun Plautus and old Ennius: they are meats
Too harsh for a weak stomach.
Use to read (But not without a tutor) the best Greeks,
As Orpheus, Musaeus, Pindarus,
Hesiod, Callimachus, and Theocrite,
High Homer; but beware of Lycophron,
He is too dark and dangerous a dish.
You must not hunt for wild outlandish terms,
To stuff out a peculiar dialect;
But let your matter run before your words.
And if at any time you chance to meet
Some Gallo-Belgic phrase; you shall not straight.
Rack your poor verse to give it entertainment,
But let it pass; and do not think yourself
Much damnified, if you do leave it out,
When nor your understanding, nor the sense
Could well receive it. This fair abstinence,
In time, will render you more sound and clear:
And this have I prescribed to you, in place
Of a strict sentence; which till he perform,
Attire him in that robe. And henceforth learn
To bear yourself more humbly; not to swell,
Or breathe your insolent and idle spite
On him whose laughter can your worst affright.

Tib.
Take him away.

Cris.
Jupiter guard Caesar!

Virg.
And for a week or two see him lock''d up
In some dark place, removed from company;
He will talk idly else after his physic.
Now to you, sir. [to Demetrius.] The extremity of law
Awards you to be branded in the front,
For this your calumny: but since it pleaseth
Horace, the party wrong''d, t'' intreat of Caesar
A mitigation of that juster doom,
With Caesar''s tongue thus we pronounce your sentence.
Demetrius Fannius, thou shalt here put on
That coat and cap, and henceforth think thyself
No other than they make thee; vow to wear them
In every fair and generous assembly,
Till the best sort of minds shall take to knowledge
As well thy satisfaction, as thy wrongs.

Hor.
Only, grave praetor, here, in open court,
I crave the oath for good behaviour
May be administer''d unto them both.

Virg.
Horace, it shall: Tibullus, give it them.

Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, lay your
hands on your hearts. You shall here solemnly attest and swear,
that never, after this instant, either at booksellers'' stalls, in
taverns, two-penny rooms, tyring-houses, noblemen''s butteries,
puisents chambers, (the best and farthest places where you are
admitted to come,) you shall once offer or dare (thereby to endear
yourself the more to any player, enghle, or guilty gull in your
company) to malign, traduce, or detract the person or writings of
Quintus Horatius Flaccus, or any other eminent men, transcending
you in merit, whom your envy shall find cause to work upon, either
for that, or for keeping himself in better acquaintance, or
enjoying better friends, or if, transported by any sudden and
desperate resolution, you do, that then you shall not under the
batoon, or in the next presence, being an honourable assembly of
his favourers, be brought as voluntary gentlemen to undertake the
for-swearing of it. Neither shall you, at any time, ambitiously
affecting the title of the Untrussers or Whippers of the age,
suffer the itch of writing to over-run your performance in libel,
upon pain of being taken up for lepers in wit, and, losing both
your time and your papers, be irrecoverably forfeited to the
hospital of fools. So help you our Roman gods and the Genius of
great Caesar.

Virg.
So! now dissolve the court.

Bor. Tib. Gal. Mec.
And thanks to Caesar, That thus hath exercised his patience.

Caes.
We have, indeed, you worthiest friends of Caesar.
It is the bane and torment of our ears,
To hear the discords of those jangling rhymers,
That with their bad and scandalous practices
Bring all true arts and learning in contempt.
But let not your high thoughts descend so low
As these despised objects; let them fall,
With their flat grovelling souls: be you yourselves;
And as with our best favours you stand crown''d,
So let your mutual loves be still renown''d.
Envy will dwell where there is want of merit,
Though the deserving man should crack his spirit.

Blush, folly, blush; here''s none that fears
The wagging of an ass''s ears,
Although a wolfish case he wears.
Detraction is but baseness'' varlet;
And apes are apes, though clothed in scarlet.

                                    HORACE AND TREBATIUS.
                                                A DIALOGUE.
                                                Sat. 1. Lib. 2.
Hor.
There are to whom I seem excessive sour,
And past a satire''s law t'' extend my power:
Others, that think whatever I have writ
Wants pith and matter to eternise it;
And that they could, in one day''s light, disclose
A thousand verses, such as I compose.
What shall I do, Trebatius? say.

Treb.
Surcease.

Hor.
And shall my muse admit no more increase?

Treb.
So I advise.

Hor.
An ill death let me die,
If ''twere not best; but sleep avoids mine eye,
And I use these, lest nights should tedious seem.

Treb.
Rather, contend to sleep, and live like them,
That, holding golden sleep in special price,
Rubb''d with sweet oils, swim silver Tyber thrice,
And every even with neat wine steeped be:
Or, if such love of writing ravish thee,
Then dare to sing unconquer''d Caesar''s deeds;
Who cheers such actions with abundant meeds.

Hor.
That, father, I desire; but, when I try,
I feel defects in every faculty:
Nor is''t a labour fit for every pen,
To paint the horrid troops of armed men,
The lances burst, in Gallia''s slaughter''d forces;
Or wounded Parthians, tumbled from their horses:
Great Caesar''s wars cannot be fought with words.

Treb.
Yet, what his virtue in his peace affords,
His fortitude and justice thou canst shew
As wise Lucilius honour''d Scipio.

Hor.
Of that, my powers shall suffer no neglect,
When such slight labours may aspire respect:
But, if I watch not a most chosen time,
The humble words of Flaccus cannot climb
Th'' attentive ear of Caesar; nor must I
With less observance shun gross flattery:
For he, reposed safe in his own merit,
Spurns back the gloses of a fawning spirit.

Treb.
But how much better would such accents sound
Than with a sad and serious verse to wound
Pantolabus, railing in his saucy jests,
Or Noment@!$% spent in riotous feasts?
In satires, each man, though untouch''d, complains
As he were hurt; and hates such biting strains.

Hor.
What shall I do? Milonius shakes his heels
In ceaseless dances, when his brain once feels
The stirring fervour of the wine ascend;
And that his eyes false numbers apprehend.
Castor his horse, Pollux loves handy-fights;
A thousand heads, a thousand choice delights.
My pleasure is in feet my words to close,
As, both our better, old Lucilius does:
He, as his trusty friends, his books did trust
With all his secrets; nor, in things unjust,
Or actions lawful, ran to other men:
So that the old man''s life described, was seen
As in a votive table in his lines:
And to his steps my genius inclines;
Lucanian, or Apulian, I know not whether,
For the Venusian colony ploughs either;
Sent thither, when the Sabines were forced thence,
As old Fame sings, to give the place defence
''Gainst such as, seeing it empty, might make road
Upon the empire; or there fix abode:
Whether the Apulian borderer it were,
Or the Lucanian violence they fear.—-
But this my style no living man shall touch,
If first I be not forced by base reproach;
But like a sheathed sword it shall defend
My innocent life; for why should I contend
To draw it out, when no malicious thief
Robs my good name, the treasure of my life?
O Jupiter, let it with rust be eaten,
Before it touch, or insolently threaten
The life of any with the least disease;
So much I love, and woo a general peace.
But, he that wrongs me, better, I proclaim,
He never had assay''d to touch my fame.
For he shall weep, and walk with every tongue
Throughout the city, infamously sung.
Servius the praetor threats the laws, and urn,
If any at his deeds repine or spurn;
The witch Canidia, that Albutius got,
Denounceth witchcraft, where she loveth not;
Thurius the judge, doth thunder worlds of ill,
To such as strive with his judicial will.
All men affright their foes in what they may,
Nature commands it, and men must obey.
Observe with me: The wolf his tooth doth use,
The bull his horn; and who doth this infuse,
But nature? There''s luxurious Scaeva; trust
His long-lived mother with him; his so just
And scrupulous right-hand no mischief will;
No more than with his heel a wolf will kill,
Or ox with jaw: marry, let him alone
With temper''d poison to remove the croan.
But briefly, if to age I destined be,
Or that quick death''s black wings environ me;
If rich, or poor; at Rome; or fate command
I shall be banished to some other land;
What hue soever my whole state shall bear,
I will write satires still, in spite of fear.

Treb.
Horace, I fear thou draw''st no lasting breath;
And that some great man''s friend will be thy death.

Hor.
What! when the man that first did satirise
Durst pull the skin over the ears of vice,
And make who stood in outward fashion clear,
Give place, as foul within; shall I forbear?
Did Laelius, or the man so great with fame,
That from sack''d Carthage fetch''d his worthy name,
Storm that Lucilius did Metellus pierce,
Or bury Lupus quick in famous verse?
Rulers and subjects, by whole tribes he checkt,
But virtue and her friends did still protect:
And when from sight, or from the judgment-seat,
The virtuous Scipio and wise Laelius met,
Unbraced, with him in all light sports they shared,
Till their most frugal suppers were prepared.
Whate''er I am, though both for wealth and wit
Beneath Lucilius I am pleased to sit;
Yet Envy, spite of her empoison''d breast,
Shall say, I lived in grace here with the best;
And seeking in weak trash to make her wound,
Shall find me solid, and her teeth unsound:
''Less learn''d Trebatius'' censure disagree.

Treb.
No, Horace, I of force must yield to thee;
Only take heed, as being advised by me,
Lest thou incur some danger: better pause,
Than rue thy ignorance of the sacred laws;
There''s justice, and great action may be sued
''Gainst such as wrong men''s fames with verses lewd.

Hor.
Ay, with lewd verses, such as libels be,
And aim''d at persons of good quality:
I reverence and adore that just decree.
But if they shall be sharp, yet modest rhymes,
That spare men''s persons, and but tax their crimes,
Such shall in open court find current pass,
Were Caesar judge, and with the maker''s grace.

Treb.
Nay, I''ll add more; if thou thyself, being clear,
Shall tax in person a man fit to bear
Shame and reproach, his suit shall quickly be
Dissolved in laughter, and thou thence set free.

                                                TO THE READER

If, by looking on what is past, thou hast deserved that name, I am
willing thou should''st yet know more, by that which follows, an
APOLOGETICAL DIALOGUE; which was only once spoken upon the stage and all the answer I ever gave to sundry impotent libels then cast out (and some yet remaining) against me, and this play. Wherein I take no pleasure to revive the times; but that posterity may make a difference between their manners that provoked me then, and mine that neglected them ever, For, in these strifes, and on such persons, were as wretched to affect a victory, as it is unhappy to be committed with them.

            Non annorum canities est laudanda, sed morum.
                                 SCENE, The Author''s Lodgings.
                              Enter NASUTUS and POLYPOSUS.
Nas.
I pray You let'' s go see him, how he looks
After these libels.

Pol.
O vex''d, vex''d, I warrant you.

Nas. Do you think so? I should be sorry for him,
If I found that.

Pol.
O, they are such bitter things,
He cannot choose.

Nas.
But, is he guilty of them?

Pol.
Fuh! that''s no matter.

Nas.
No!

Pol.
No. Here''s his lodging.
We''ll steal upon him: or let''s listen; stay.
He has a humour oft to talk t'' himself.

Nas.
They are your manners lead me, not mine own.

[They come forward; the scene opens, and discovers the
Author in his study.
Aut.
The fates have not spun him the coarsest thread,
That (free from knots of perturbation)
Doth yet so live, although but to himself,
As he can safely scorn the tongues of slaves,
And neglect fortune, more than she can him.
It is the happiest thing this, not to be
Within the reach of malice; it provides
A man so well, to laugh off injuries;
And never sends him farther for his vengeance,
Than the vex''d bosom of his enemy.
I, now, but think how poor their spite sets off,
Who, after all their waste of sulphurous terms,
And burst-out thunder of their charged mouths,
Have nothing left but the unsavoury smoke
Of their black vomit, to upbraid themselves:
Whilst I, at whom they shot, sit here shot-free,
And as unhurt of envy, as unhit.

[Pol. and Nas. discover themselves.
Pol.
Ay, but the multitude they think not so, sir,
They think you hit, and hurt: and dare give out,
Your silence argues it in not rejoining
To this or that late libel.

Aut.
''Las, good rout!
I can afford them leave to err so still;
And like the barking students of Bears-college,
To swallow up the garbage of the time
With greedy gullets, whilst myself sit by,
Pleased, and yet tortured, with their beastly feeding.
''Tis a sweet madness runs along with them,
To think, all that are aim''d at still are struck:
Then, where the shaft still lights, make that the mark:
And so each fear or fever-shaken fool
May challenge Teucer''s hand in archery.
Good troth, if I knew any man so vile,
To act the crimes these Whippers reprehend,
Or what their servile apes gesticulate,
I should not then much muse their shreds were liked;
Since ill men have a lust t'' hear others'' sins,
All good men have a zeal to hear sin shamed.
But when it is all excrement they vent,
Base filth and offal; or thefts, notable
As ocean-piracies, or highway-stands;
And not a crime there tax''d, but is their own,
Or what their own foul thoughts suggested to them;
And that, in all their heat of taxing others,
Not one of them but lives himself, if known,
Improbior satiram scribente cinaedo
What should I say more, than turn stone with wonder!

Nas.
I never saw this play bred all this tumult:
What was there in it could so deeply offend
And stir so many hornets?

Aut.
Shall I tell you?

Nas.
Yea, and ingeniously.

Aut.
Then, by the hope
Which I prefer unto all other objects,
I can profess, I never writ that piece
More innocent or empty of offence.
Some salt it had, but neither tooth nor gall,
Nor was there in it any circumstance
Which. in the setting down, I could suspect
Might be perverted by an enemy''s tongue;
Only it had the fault to be call''d mine;
That was the crime.

Pol.
No! why, they say you tax''d
The law and lawyers, captains and the players,
By their particular names.

Aut.
It is not so.
I used no name. My books have still been taught
To spare the persons, and to speak the vices.
These are mere slanders, and enforced by such
As have no safer ways to men''s disgraces.
But their own lies and loss of honesty:
Fellows of practised and most laxative tongues,
Whose empty and eager bellies, in the year,
Compel their brains to many desperate shifts,
(I spare to name them, for their wretchedness
Fury itself would pardon). These, or such,
Whether of malice, or of ignorance,
Or itch t'' have me their adversary, I know not,
Or all these mixt; but sure I am, three years
They did provoke me with their petulant styles
On every stage: and I at last unwilling,
But weary, I confess, of so much trouble,
Thought I would try if shame could win upon ''em,''
And therefore chose Augustus Caesar''s times,
When wit and area were at their height in Rome,
To shew that Virgil, Horace, and the rest
Of those great master-spirits, did not want
Detractors then, or practicers against them:
And by this line, although no parallel,
I hoped at last they would sit down and blush;
But nothing I could find more contrary.
And though the impudence of flies be great,
Yet this hath so provok''d the angry wasps,
Or, as you said, of the next nest, the hornets,
That they fly buzzing, mad, about my nostrils,
And, like so many screaming grasshoppers
Held by the wings, fill every ear with noise.
And what? those former calumnies you mention''d.
First, of the law: indeed I brought in Ovid
Chid by his angry father for neglecting
The study of their laws for poetry:
And I am warranted by his own words:

Saepe pater dixit, studium quid inutile tentas!
Maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes.

And in far harsher terms elsewhere, as these:

Non me verbosas leges ediscere, non me
Ingrato voces prostituisse foro.

But how this should relate unto our laws,
Or the just ministers, with least abuse,
I reverence both too much to understand!
Then, for the captain, I will only speak
An epigram I here have made: it is

UNTO TRUE SOLDIERS.
That''s the lemma: mark it.
Strength of my country, whilst I bring to view
Such: as are miss-call''d captains, and wrong you,
And your high names; I do desire, that thence,
Be nor put on you, nor you take offence:
I swear by your true friend, my muse, I love
Your great profession which I once did prove;
And did not shame it with my actions then,
No more than I dare now do with my pen.
He that not trusts me, having vowed thus much,
But''s angry for the captain, still: is such.
Now for the players, it is true, I tax''d them,
And yet but some; and those so sparingly,
As all the rest might have sat still unquestion''d,
Had they but had the wit or conscience
To think well of themselves. But impotent, they
Thought each man''s vice belong''d to their whole tribe;
And much good do''t them! What they have done ''gainst me,
I am not moved with: if it gave them meat,
Or got them clothes, ''tis well; that was their end.
Only amongst them, I am sorry for
Some better natures, by the rest so drawn,
To run in that vile line.

Pol.
And is this all!
Will you not answer then the libels?

Aut.
No.

Pol.
Nor the Untrussers?

Aut.
Neither.

Pol.
Y''are undone then.

Aut.
With whom?

Pol.
The world.

Aut.
The bawd!

Pol.
It will be taken
To be stupidity or tameness in you.

Aut.
But they that have incensed me, can in soul
Acquit me of that guilt. They know I dare
To spurn or baffle them, or squirt their eyes
With ink or urine; or I could do worse,
Arm''d with Archilochus'' fury, write Iambics,
Should make the desperate lashers hang themselves;
Rhime them to death, as they do Irish rats
In drumming tunes. Or, living, I could stamp
Their foreheads with those deep and public brands,
That the whole company of barber-surgeon a
Should not take off with all their art and plasters.
And these my prints should last, still to be read
In their pale fronts; when, what they write ''gainst me
Shall, like a figure drawn in water, fleet,
And the poor wretched papers be employed
To clothe tobacco, or some cheaper drug:
This I could do, and make them infamous.
But, to what end? when their own deeds have mark''d ''em;
And that I know, within his guilty breast
Each slanderer bears a whip that shall torment him
Worse than a million of these temporal plagues:
Which to pursue, were but a feminine humour,
And far beneath the dignity of man.

Nas.
''Tis true; for to revenge their injuries,
Were to confess you felt them. Let them go,
And use the treasure of the fool, their tongues,
Who makes his gain, by speaking worst of beat.

Pol.
O, but they lay particular imputations—

Aut.
As what?

Pol.
That all your writing is mere railing.

Aut.
Ha?
If all the salt in the old comedy
Should be so censured, or the sharper wit
Of the bold satire termed scolding rage,
What age could then compare with those for buffoons?
What should be said of Aristophanes,
Persius, or Juvenal, whose names we now
So glorify in schools, at least pretend it?—-
Have they no other?

Pol.
Yes; they say you are slow,
And scarce bring forth a play a year.

Aut.
''Tis true.
I would they could not say that I did that!
There'' s all the joy that I take in their trade,
Unless such scribes as these might be proscribed
Th'' abused theatres. They would think it strange, now,
A man should take but colts-foot for one day,
And, between whiles, spit out a better poem
Than e''er the master of art, or giver of wit,
Their belly, made. Yet, this is possible,
If a free mind had but the patience,
To think so much together and so vile.
But that these base and beggarly conceits
Should carry it, by the multitude of voices,
Against the most abstracted work, opposed
To the stuff''d nostrils of the drunken rout!
O, this would make a learn''d and liberal soul
To rive his stained quill up to the back,
And damn his long-watch''d labours to the fire,
Things that were born when none but the still night
And his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes,
Were not his own free merit a more crown
Unto his travails than their reeling claps.
This ''tis that strikes me silent, seals my lips,
And apts me rather to sleep out my time,
Than I would waste it in contemned strifes
With these vile Ibides, these unclean birds,
That make their mouths their clysters, and still purge
From their hot entrails. But I leave the monsters
To their own fate. And, since the Comic Muse
Hath proved so ominous to me, I will try
If TRAGEDY have a more kind aspect;
Her favours in my next I will pursue,
Where, if I prove the pleasure but of one,
So he judicious be, he shall be alone
A theatre unto me; Once I''ll say
To strike the ear of time in those fresh strains,
As shall, beside the cunning of their ground,
Give cause to some of wonder, some despite,
And more despair, to imitate their sound.
I, that spend half my nights, and all my days,
Here in a cell, to get a dark paleface,
To come forth worth the ivy or the bays,
And in this age can hope no other grace—-
Leave me! There''s something come into my thought,
That must and shall be sung high and aloof,
Safe from the wolfs black jaw, and the dun ass''s hoof

Nas.
I reverence these raptures, and obey them.

Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I''m fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock''s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I''m tripping off the powder
''Til then, !#%@ that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole !#%@in'' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama''s nation
Well, that''s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I''m killing this !@#$
I know damn well y''all feeling this !@#$
I don''t need your %!$#@, bitch, I''m on my own !#$#
I ain''t gotta power trip, who you goin'' home with?
How Ye doing? I''m survivin''
I was drinkin'' earlier, now I''m drivin''
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin''?
I got the power make your life so excitin''

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I''m jumping out the window, I''m letting everything go
I''m letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I''m jumping out the window, I''m letting everything go
I''m letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

        Ursula went on in an unreal suspense, the last weeks before going away. She was not herself,—she was not anything. She was something that is going to be—soon—soon—very soon. But as yet, she was only imminent.

        She went to see her parents. It was a rather stiff, sad meeting, more like a verification of separateness than a reunion. But they were all vague and indefinite with one another, stiffened in the fate that moved them apart.

        She did not really come to until she was on the ship crossing from Dover to Ostend. Dimly she had come down to London with Birkin, London had been a vagueness, so had the train-journey to Dover. It was all like a sleep.

        And now, at last, as she stood in the stern of the ship, in a pitch-dark, rather blowy night, feeling the motion of the sea, and watching the small, rather desolate little lights that twinkled on the shores of England, as on the shores of nowhere, watched them sinking smaller and smaller on the profound and living darkness, she felt her soul stirring to awake from its anaesthetic sleep.

        ''Let us go forward, shall we?'' said Birkin. He wanted to be at the tip of their projection. So they left off looking at the faint sparks that glimmered out of nowhere, in the far distance, called England, and turned their faces to the unfathomed night in front.

        They went right to the bows of the softly plunging vessel. In the complete obscurity, Birkin found a comparatively sheltered nook, where a great rope was coiled up. It was quite near the very point of the ship, near the black, unpierced space ahead. There they sat down, folded together, folded round with the same rug, creeping in nearer and ever nearer to one another, till it seemed they had crept right into each other, and become one substance. It was very cold, and the darkness was palpable.

        One of the ship''s crew came along the deck, dark as the darkness, not really visible. They then made out the faintest pallor of his face. He felt their presence, and stopped, unsure—then bent forward. When his face was near them, he saw the faint pallor of their faces. Then he withdrew like a phantom. And they watched him without making any sound.

        They seemed to fall away into the profound darkness. There was no sky, no earth, only one unbroken darkness, into which, with a soft, sleeping motion, they seemed to fall like one closed seed of life falling through dark, fathomless space.

        They had forgotten where they were, forgotten all that was and all that had been, conscious only in their heart, and there conscious only of this pure trajectory through the surpassing darkness. The ship''s prow cleaved on, with a faint noise of cleavage, into the complete night, without knowing, without seeing, only surging on.

        In Ursula the sense of the unrealised world ahead triumphed over everything. In the midst of this profound darkness, there seemed to glow on her heart the effulgence of a paradise unknown and unrealised. Her heart was full of the most wonderful light, golden like honey of darkness, sweet like the warmth of day, a light which was not shed on the world, only on the unknown paradise towards which she was going, a sweetness of habitation, a delight of living quite unknown, but hers infallibly. In her transport she lifted her face suddenly to him, and he touched it with his lips. So cold, so fresh, so sea-clear her face was, it was like kissing a flower that grows near the surf.

        But he did not know the ecstasy of bliss in fore-knowledge that she knew. To him, the wonder of this transit was overwhelming. He was falling through a gulf of infinite darkness, like a meteorite plunging across the chasm between the worlds. The world was torn in two, and he was plunging like an unlit star through the ineffable rift. What was beyond was not yet for him. He was overcome by the trajectory.

        In a trance he lay enfolding Ursula round about. His face was against her fine, fragile hair, he breathed its fragrance with the sea and the profound night. And his soul was at peace; yielded, as he fell into the unknown. This was the first time that an utter and absolute peace had entered his heart, now, in this final transit out of life.
        When there came some stir on the deck, they roused. They stood up. How stiff and cramped they were, in the night-time! And yet the paradisal glow on her heart, and the unutterable peace of darkness in his, this was the all-in-all.

        They stood up and looked ahead. Low lights were seen down the darkness. This was the world again. It was not the bliss of her heart, nor the peace of his. It was the superficial unreal world of fact. Yet not quite the old world. For the peace and the bliss in their hearts was enduring.

        Strange, and desolate above all things, like disembarking from the Styx into the desolated underworld, was this landing at night. There was the raw, half-lighted, covered-in vastness of the dark place, boarded and hollow underfoot, with only desolation everywhere. Ursula had caught sight of the big, pallid, mystic letters ''OSTEND,'' standing in the darkness. Everybody was hurrying with a blind, insect-like intentness through the dark grey air, porters were calling in un-English English, then trotting with heavy bags, their colourless blouses looking ghostly as they disappeared; Ursula stood at a long, low, zinc-covered barrier, along with hundreds of other spectral people, and all the way down the vast, raw darkness was this low stretch of open bags and spectral people, whilst, on the other side of the barrier, pallid officials in peaked caps and moustaches were turning the underclothing in the bags, then scrawling a chalk-mark.

        It was done. Birkin snapped the hand bags, off they went, the porter coming behind. They were through a great doorway, and in the open night again—ah, a railway platform! Voices were still calling in inhuman agitation through the dark-grey air, spectres were running along the darkness between the train.

        ''Koln—Berlin—'' Ursula made out on the boards hung on the high train on one side.

        ''Here we are,'' said Birkin. And on her side she saw: ''Elsass—Lothringen—Luxembourg, Metz—Basle.''

        ''That was it, Basle!''

        The porter came up.

        ''A Bale—deuxieme classe?—Voila!'' And he clambered into the high train. They followed. The compartments were already some of them taken. But many were dim and empty. The luggage was stowed, the porter was tipped.

        ''Nous avons encore—?'' said Birkin, looking at his watch and at the porter.

        ''Encore une demi-heure.'' With which, in his blue blouse, he disappeared. He was ugly and insolent.

        ''Come,'' said Birkin. ''It is cold. Let us eat.''

        There was a coffee-wagon on the platform. They drank hot, watery coffee, and ate the long rolls, split, with ham between, which were such a wide bite that it almost dislocated Ursula''s jaw; and they walked beside the high trains. It was all so strange, so extremely desolate, like the underworld, grey, grey, dirt grey, desolate, forlorn, nowhere—grey, dreary nowhere.
        At last they were moving through the night. In the darkness Ursula made out the flat fields, the wet flat dreary darkness of the Continent. They pulled up surprisingly soon—Bruges! Then on through the level darkness, with glimpses of sleeping farms and thin poplar trees and deserted high-roads. She sat dismayed, hand in hand with Birkin. He pale, immobile like a REVENANT himself, looked sometimes out of the window, sometimes closed his eyes. Then his eyes opened again, dark as the darkness outside.

        A flash of a few lights on the darkness—Ghent station! A few more spectres moving outside on the platform—then the bell—then motion again through the level darkness. Ursula saw a man with a lantern come out of a farm by the railway, and cross to the dark farm-buildings. She thought of the Marsh, the old, intimate farm-life at Cossethay. My God, how far was she projected from her childhood, how far was she still to go! In one life-time one travelled through aeons. The great chasm of memory from her childhood in the intimate country surroundings of Cossethay and the Marsh Farm—she remembered the servant Tilly, who used to give her bread and butter sprinkled with brown sugar, in the old living-room where the grandfather clock had two pink roses in a basket painted above the figures on the face—and now when she was travelling into the unknown with Birkin, an utter stranger—was so great, that it seemed she had no identity, that the child she had been, playing in Cossethay churchyard, was a little creature of history, not really herself.

        They were at Brussels—half an hour for breakfast. They got down. On the great station clock it said six o''clock. They had coffee and rolls and honey in the vast desert refreshment room, so dreary, always so dreary, dirty, so spacious, such desolation of space. But she washed her face and hands in hot water, and combed her hair—that was a blessing.

        Soon they were in the train again and moving on. The greyness of dawn began. There were several people in the compartment, large florid Belgian business-men with long brown beards, talking incessantly in an ugly French she was too tired to follow.

        It seemed the train ran by degrees out of the darkness into a faint light, then beat after beat into the day. Ah, how weary it was! Faintly, the trees showed, like shadows. Then a house, white, had a curious distinctness. How was it? Then she saw a village—there were always houses passing.

        This was an old world she was still journeying through, winter-heavy and dreary. There was plough-land and pasture, and copses of bare trees, copses of bushes, and homesteads naked and work-bare. No new earth had come to pass.

        She looked at Birkin''s face. It was white and still and eternal, too eternal. She linked her fingers imploringly in his, under the cover of her rug. His fingers responded, his eyes looked back at her. How dark, like a night, his eyes were, like another world beyond! Oh, if he were the world as well, if only the world were he! If only he could call a world into being, that should be their own world!

        The Belgians left, the train ran on, through Luxembourg, through Alsace-Lorraine, through Metz. But she was blind, she could see no more. Her soul did not look out.

        They came at last to Basle, to the hotel. It was all a drifting trance, from which she never came to. They went out in the morning, before the train departed. She saw the street, the river, she stood on the bridge. But it all meant nothing. She remembered some shops—one full of pictures, one with orange velvet and ermine. But what did these signify?—nothing.

        She was not at ease till they were in the train again. Then she was relieved. So long as they were moving onwards, she was satisfied. They came to Zurich, then, before very long, ran under the mountains, that were deep in snow. At last she was drawing near. This was the other world now.

        Innsbruck was wonderful, deep in snow, and evening. They drove in an open sledge over the snow: the train had been so hot and stifling. And the hotel, with the golden light glowing under the porch, seemed like a home.

        They laughed with pleasure when they were in the hall. The place seemed full and busy.

        ''Do you know if Mr and Mrs Crich—English—from Paris, have arrived?'' Birkin asked in German.
        The porter reflected a moment, and was just going to answer, when Ursula caught sight of Gudrun sauntering down the stairs, wearing her dark glossy coat, with grey fur.

        ''Gudrun! Gudrun!'' she called, waving up the well of the staircase. ''Shu-hu!''

        Gudrun looked over the rail, and immediately lost her sauntering, diffident air. Her eyes flashed.

        ''Really—Ursula!'' she cried. And she began to move downstairs as Ursula ran up. They met at a turn and kissed with laughter and exclamations inarticulate and stirring.

        ''But!'' cried Gudrun, mortified. ''We thought it was TOMORROW you were coming! I wanted to come to the station.''

        ''No, we''ve come today!'' cried Ursula. ''Isn''t it lovely here!''

        ''Adorable!'' said Gudrun. ''Gerald''s just gone out to get something. Ursula, aren''t you FEARFULLY tired?''

        ''No, not so very. But I look a filthy sight, don''t I!''

        ''No, you don''t. You look almost perfectly fresh. I like that fur cap IMMENSELY!'' She glanced over Ursula, who wore a big soft coat with a collar of deep, soft, blond fur, and a soft blond cap of fur.

        ''And you!'' cried Ursula. ''What do you think YOU look like!''

        Gudrun assumed an unconcerned, expressionless face.

        ''Do you like it?'' she said.

        ''It''s VERY fine!'' cried Ursula, perhaps with a touch of satire.

        ''Go up—or come down,'' said Birkin. For there the sisters stood, Gudrun with her hand on Ursula''s arm, on the turn of the stairs half way to the first landing, blocking the way and affording full entertainment to the whole of the hall below, from the door porter to the plump Jew in black clothes.

        The two young women slowly mounted, followed by Birkin and the waiter.

        ''First floor?'' asked Gudrun, looking back over her shoulder.

        ''Second Madam—the lift!'' the waiter replied. And he darted to the elevator to forestall the two women. But they ignored him, as, chattering without heed, they set to mount the second flight. Rather chagrined, the waiter followed.

        It was curious, the delight of the sisters in each other, at this meeting. It was as if they met in exile, and united their solitary forces against all the world. Birkin looked on with some mistrust and wonder.

        When they had bathed and changed, Gerald came in. He looked shining like the sun on frost.

        ''Go with Gerald and smoke,'' said Ursula to Birkin. ''Gudrun and I want to talk.''

        Then the sisters sat in Gudrun''s bedroom, and talked clothes, and experiences. Gudrun told Ursula the experience of the Birkin letter in the cafe. Ursula was shocked and frightened.

        ''Where is the letter?'' she asked.

        ''I kept it,'' said Gudrun.

        ''You''ll give it me, won''t you?'' she said.

        But Gudrun was silent for some moments, before she replied:

        ''Do you really want it, Ursula?''

        ''I want to read it,'' said Ursula.

        ''Certainly,'' said Gudrun.

        Even now, she could not admit, to Ursula, that she wanted to keep it, as a memento, or a symbol. But Ursula knew, and was not pleased. So the subject was switched off.

        ''What did you do in Paris?'' asked Ursula.

        ''Oh,'' said Gudrun laconically—''the usual things. We had a FINE party one night in Fanny Bath''s studio.''

        ''Did you? And you and Gerald were there! Who else? Tell me about it.''

        ''Well,'' said Gudrun. ''There''s nothing particular to tell. You know Fanny is FRIGHTFULLY in love with that painter, Billy Macfarlane. He was there—so Fanny spared nothing, she spent VERY freely. It was really remarkable! Of course, everybody got fearfully drunk—but in an interesting way, not like that filthy London crowd. The fact is these were all people that matter, which makes all the difference. There was a Roumanian, a fine chap. He got completely drunk, and climbed to the top of a high studio ladder, and gave the most marvellous address—really, Ursula, it was wonderful! He began in French—La vie, c''est une affaire d''ames imperiales—in a most beautiful voice—he was a fine-looking chap—but he had got into Roumanian before he had finished, and not a soul understood. But Donald Gilchrist was worked to a frenzy. He dashed his glass to the ground, and declared, by God, he was glad he had been born, by God, it was a miracle to be alive. And do you know, Ursula, so it was—'' Gudrun laughed rather hollowly.

        ''But how was Gerald among them all?'' asked Ursula.

        ''Gerald! Oh, my word, he came out like a dandelion in the sun! HE''S a whole saturnalia in himself, once he is roused. I shouldn''t like to say whose waist his arm did not go round. Really, Ursula, he seems to reap the women like a harvest. There wasn''t one that would have resisted him. It was too amazing! Can you understand it?''

        Ursula reflected, and a dancing light came into her eyes.

        ''Yes,'' she said. ''I can. He is such a whole-hogger.''

        ''Whole-hogger! I should think so!'' exclaimed Gudrun. ''But it is true, Ursula, every woman in the room was ready to surrender to him. Chanticleer isn''t in it—even Fanny Bath, who is GENUINELY in love with Billy Macfarlane! I never was more amazed in my life! And you know, afterwards—I felt I was a whole ROOMFUL of women. I was no more myself to him, than I was Queen Victoria. I was a whole roomful of women at once. It was most astounding! But my eye, I''d caught a Sultan that time—''

        Gudrun''s eyes were flashing, her cheek was hot, she looked strange, exotic, satiric. Ursula was fascinated at once—and yet uneasy.

        They had to get ready for dinner. Gudrun came down in a daring gown of vivid green silk and tissue of gold, with green velvet bodice and a strange black-and-white band round her hair. She was really brilliantly beautiful and everybody noticed her. Gerald was in that full-blooded, gleaming state when he was most handsome. Birkin watched them with quick, laughing, half-sinister eyes, Ursula quite lost her head. There seemed a spell, almost a blinding spell, cast round their table, as if they were lighted up more strongly than the rest of the dining-room.

        ''Don''t you love to be in this place?'' cried Gudrun. ''Isn''t the snow wonderful! Do you notice how it exalts everything? It is simply marvellous. One really does feel LIBERMENSCHLICH—more than human.''

        ''One does,'' cried Ursula. ''But isn''t that partly the being out of England?''

        ''Oh, of course,'' cried Gudrun. ''One could never feel like this in England, for the simple reason that the damper is NEVER lifted off one, there. It is quite impossible really to let go, in England, of that I am assured.''

        And she turned again to the food she was eating. She was fluttering with vivid intensity.

        ''It''s quite true,'' said Gerald, ''it never is quite the same in England. But perhaps we don''t want it to be—perhaps it''s like bringing the light a little too near the powder-magazine, to let go altogether, in England. One is afraid what might happen, if EVERYBODY ELSE let go.''

        ''My God!'' cried Gudrun. ''But wouldn''t it be wonderful, if all England did suddenly go off like a display of fireworks.''

        ''It couldn''t,'' said Ursula. ''They are all too damp, the powder is damp in them.''

        ''I''m not so sure of that,'' said Gerald.

        ''Nor I,'' said Birkin. ''When the English really begin to go off, EN MASSE, it''ll be time to shut your ears and run.''

        ''They never will,'' said Ursula.

        ''We''ll see,'' he replied.

        ''Isn''t it marvellous,'' said Gudrun, ''how thankful one can be, to be out of one''s country. I cannot believe myself, I am so transported, the moment I set foot on a foreign shore. I say to myself "Here steps a new creature into life."''

        ''Don''t be too hard on poor old England,'' said Gerald. ''Though we curse it, we love it really.''

        To Ursula, there seemed a fund of cynicism in these words.

        ''We may,'' said Birkin. ''But it''s a damnably uncomfortable love: like a love for an aged parent who suffers horribly from a complication of diseases, for which there is no hope.''

        Gudrun looked at him with dilated dark eyes.

        ''You think there is no hope?'' she asked, in her pertinent fashion.

        But Birkin backed away. He would not answer such a question.

        ''Any hope of England''s becoming real? God knows. It''s a great actual unreality now, an aggregation into unreality. It might be real, if there were no Englishmen.''

        ''You think the English will have to disappear?'' persisted Gudrun. It was strange, her pointed interest in his answer. It might have been her own fate she was inquiring after. Her dark, dilated eyes rested on Birkin, as if she could conjure the truth of the future out of him, as out of some instrument of divination.

        He was pale. Then, reluctantly, he answered:

        ''Well—what else is in front of them, but disappearance? They''ve got to disappear from their own special brand of Englishness, anyhow.''

        Gudrun watched him as if in a hypnotic state, her eyes wide and fixed on him.

        ''But in what way do you mean, disappear?—'' she persisted.

        ''Yes, do you mean a change of heart?'' put in Gerald.

        ''I don''t mean anything, why should I?'' said Birkin. ''I''m an Englishman, and I''ve paid the price of it. I can''t talk about England—I can only speak for myself.''

        ''Yes,'' said Gudrun slowly, ''you love England immensely, IMMENSELY, Rupert.''

        ''And leave her,'' he replied.

        ''No, not for good. You''ll come back,'' said Gerald, nodding sagely.

        ''They say the lice crawl off a dying body,'' said Birkin, with a glare of bitterness. ''So I leave England.''

        ''Ah, but you''ll come back,'' said Gudrun, with a sardonic smile.

        ''Tant pis pour moi,'' he replied.

        ''Isn''t he angry with his mother country!'' laughed Gerald, amused.

        ''Ah, a patriot!'' said Gudrun, with something like a sneer.

        Birkin refused to answer any more.

        Gudrun watched him still for a few seconds. Then she turned away. It was finished, her spell of divination in him. She felt already purely cynical. She looked at Gerald. He was wonderful like a piece of radium to her. She felt she could consume herself and know ALL, by means of this fatal, living metal. She smiled to herself at her fancy. And what would she do with herself, when she had destroyed herself? For if spirit, if integral being is destructible, Matter is indestructible.

        He was looking bright and abstracted, puzzled, for the moment. She stretched out her beautiful arm, with its fluff of green tulle, and touched his chin with her subtle, artist''s fingers.

        ''What are they then?'' she asked, with a strange, knowing smile.

        ''What?'' he replied, his eyes suddenly dilating with wonder.

        ''Your thoughts.''

        Gerald looked like a man coming awake.

        ''I think I had none,'' he said.

        ''Really!'' she said, with grave laughter in her voice.

        And to Birkin it was as if she killed Gerald, with that touch.

        ''Ah but,'' cried Gudrun, ''let us drink to Britannia—let us drink to Britannia.''

        It seemed there was wild despair in her voice. Gerald laughed, and filled the glasses.

        ''I think Rupert means,'' he said, ''that NATIONALLY all Englishmen must die, so that they can exist individually and—''

        ''Super-nationally—'' put in Gudrun, with a slight ironic grimace, raising her glass.

        The next day, they descended at the tiny railway station of Hohenhausen, at the end of the tiny valley railway. It was snow everywhere, a white, perfect cradle of snow, new and frozen, sweeping up an either side, black crags, and white sweeps of silver towards the blue pale heavens.

        As they stepped out on the naked platform, with only snow around and above, Gudrun shrank as if it chilled her heart.

        ''My God, Jerry,'' she said, turning to Gerald with sudden intimacy, ''you''ve done it now.''

        ''What?''

        She made a faint gesture, indicating the world on either hand.

        ''Look at it!''

        She seemed afraid to go on. He laughed.

        They were in the heart of the mountains. From high above, on either side, swept down the white fold of snow, so that one seemed small and tiny in a valley of pure concrete heaven, all strangely radiant and changeless and silent.

        ''It makes one feel so small and alone,'' said Ursula, turning to Birkin and laying her hand on his arm.

        ''You''re not sorry you''ve come, are you?'' said Gerald to Gudrun.

        She looked doubtful. They went out of the station between banks of snow.

        ''Ah,'' said Gerald, sniffing the air in elation, ''this is perfect. There''s our sledge. We''ll walk a bit—we''ll run up the road.''

        Gudrun, always doubtful, dropped her heavy coat on the sledge, as he did his, and they set off. Suddenly she threw up her head and set off scudding along the road of snow, pulling her cap down over her ears. Her blue, bright dress fluttered in the wind, her thick scarlet stockings were brilliant above the whiteness. Gerald watched her: she seemed to be rushing towards her fate, and leaving him behind. He let her get some distance, then, loosening his limbs, he went after her.

        Everywhere was deep and silent snow. Great snow-eaves weighed down the broad-roofed Tyrolese houses, that were sunk to the window-sashes in snow. Peasant-women, full-skirted, wearing each a cross-over shawl, and thick snow-boots, turned in the way to look at the soft, determined girl running with such heavy fleetness from the man, who was overtaking her, but not gaining any power over her.

        They passed the inn with its painted shutters and balcony, a few cottages, half buried in the snow; then the snow-buried silent sawmill by the roofed bridge, which crossed the hidden stream, over which they ran into the very depth of the untouched sheets of snow. It was a silence and a sheer whiteness exhilarating to madness. But the perfect silence was most terrifying, isolating the soul, surrounding the heart with frozen air.

        ''It''s a marvellous place, for all that,'' said Gudrun, looking into his eyes with a strange, meaning look. His soul leapt.

        ''Good,'' he said.

        A fierce electric energy seemed to flow over all his limbs, his muscles were surcharged, his hands felt hard with strength. They walked along rapidly up the snow-road, that was marked by withered branches of trees stuck in at intervals. He and she were separate, like opposite poles of one fierce energy. But they felt powerful enough to leap over the confines of life into the forbidden places, and back again.

        Birkin and Ursula were running along also, over the snow. He had disposed of the luggage, and they had a little start of the sledges. Ursula was excited and happy, but she kept turning suddenly to catch hold of Birkin''s arm, to make sure of him.

        ''This is something I never expected,'' she said. ''It is a different world, here.''

        They went on into a snow meadow. There they were overtaken by the sledge, that came tinkling through the silence. It was another mile before they came upon Gudrun and Gerald on the steep up-climb, beside the pink, half-buried shrine.

        Then they passed into a gulley, where were walls of black rock and a river filled with snow, and a still blue sky above. Through a covered bridge they went, drumming roughly over the boards, crossing the snow-bed once more, then slowly up and up, the horses walking swiftly, the driver cracking his long whip as he walked beside, and calling his strange wild HUE-HUE!, the walls of rock passing slowly by, till they emerged again between slopes and masses of snow. Up and up, gradually they went, through the cold shadow-radiance of the afternoon, silenced by the imminence of the mountains, the luminous, dazing sides of snow that rose above them and fell away beneath.

        They came forth at last in a little high table-land of snow, where stood the last peaks of snow like the heart petals of an open rose. In the midst of the last deserted valleys of heaven stood a lonely building with brown wooden walls and white heavy roof, deep and deserted in the waste of snow, like a dream. It stood like a rock that had rolled down from the last steep slopes, a rock that had taken the form of a house, and was now half-buried. It was unbelievable that one could live there uncrushed by all this terrible waste of whiteness and silence and clear, upper, ringing cold.

        Yet the sledges ran up in fine style, people came to the door laughing and excited, the floor of the hostel rang hollow, the passage was wet with snow, it was a real, warm interior.

        The new-comers tramped up the bare wooden stairs, following the serving woman. Gudrun and Gerald took the first bedroom. In a moment they found themselves alone in a bare, smallish, close-shut room that was all of golden-coloured wood, floor, walls, ceiling, door, all of the same warm gold panelling of oiled pine. There was a window opposite the door, but low down, because the roof sloped. Under the slope of the ceiling were the table with wash-hand bowl and jug, and across, another table with mirror. On either side the door were two beds piled high with an enormous blue-checked overbolster, enormous.

        This was all—no cupboard, none of the amenities of life. Here they were shut up together in this cell of golden-coloured wood, with two blue checked beds. They looked at each other and laughed, frightened by this naked nearness of isolation.

        A man knocked and came in with the luggage. He was a sturdy fellow with flattish cheek-bones, rather pale, and with coarse fair moustache. Gudrun watched him put down the bags, in silence, then tramp heavily out.

        ''It isn''t too rough, is it?'' Gerald asked.

        The bedroom was not very warm, and she shivered slightly.

        ''It is wonderful,'' she equivocated. ''Look at the colour of this panelling—it''s wonderful, like being inside a nut.''

        He was standing watching her, feeling his short-cut moustache, leaning back slightly and watching her with his keen, undaunted eyes, dominated by the constant passion, that was like a doom upon him.

        She went and crouched down in front of the window, curious.

        ''Oh, but this—!'' she cried involuntarily, almost in pain.

        In front was a valley shut in under the sky, the last huge slopes of snow and black rock, and at the end, like the navel of the earth, a white-folded wall, and two peaks glimmering in the late light. Straight in front ran the cradle of silent snow, between the great slopes that were fringed with a little roughness of pine-trees, like hair, round the base. But the cradle of snow ran on to the eternal closing-in, where the walls of snow and rock rose impenetrable, and the mountain peaks above were in heaven immediate. This was the centre, the knot, the navel of the world, where the earth belonged to the skies, pure, unapproachable, impassable.

        It filled Gudrun with a strange rapture. She crouched in front of the window, clenching her face in her hands, in a sort of trance. At last she had arrived, she had reached her place. Here at last she folded her venture and settled down like a crystal in the navel of snow, and was gone.

        Gerald bent above her and was looking out over her shoulder. Already he felt he was alone. She was gone. She was completely gone, and there was icy vapour round his heart. He saw the blind valley, the great cul-de-sac of snow and mountain peaks, under the heaven. And there was no way out. The terrible silence and cold and the glamorous whiteness of the dusk wrapped him round, and she remained crouching before the window, as at a shrine, a shadow.

        ''Do you like it?'' he asked, in a voice that sounded detached and foreign. At least she might acknowledge he was with her. But she only averted her soft, mute face a little from his gaze. And he knew that there were tears in her eyes, her own tears, tears of her strange religion, that put him to nought.

        Quite suddenly, he put his hand under her chin and lifted up her face to him. Her dark blue eyes, in their wetness of tears, dilated as if she was startled in her very soul. They looked at him through their tears in terror and a little horror. His light blue eyes were keen, small-pupilled and unnatural in their vision. Her lips parted, as she breathed with difficulty.

        The passion came up in him, stroke after stroke, like the ringing of a bronze bell, so strong and unflawed and indomitable. His knees tightened to bronze as he hung above her soft face, whose lips parted and whose eyes dilated in a strange violation. In the grasp of his hand her chin was unutterably soft and silken. He felt strong as winter, his hands were living metal, invincible and not to be turned aside. His heart rang like a bell clanging inside him.

        He took her up in his arms. She was soft and inert, motionless. All the while her eyes, in which the tears had not yet dried, were dilated as if in a kind of swoon of fascination and helplessness. He was superhumanly strong, and unflawed, as if invested with supernatural force.

        He lifted her close and folded her against him. Her softness, her inert, relaxed weight lay against his own surcharged, bronze-like limbs in a heaviness of desirability that would destroy him, if he were not fulfilled. She moved convulsively, recoiling away from him. His heart went up like a flame of ice, he closed over her like steel. He would destroy her rather than be denied.

        But the overweening power of his body was too much for her. She relaxed again, and lay loose and soft, panting in a little delirium. And to him, she was so sweet, she was such bliss of release, that he would have suffered a whole eternity of torture rather than forego one second of this pang of unsurpassable bliss.

        ''My God,'' he said to her, his face drawn and strange, transfigured, ''what next?''

        She lay perfectly still, with a still, child-like face and dark eyes, looking at him. She was lost, fallen right away.

        ''I shall always love you,'' he said, looking at her.

        But she did not hear. She lay, looking at him as at something she could never understand, never: as a child looks at a grown-up person, without hope of understanding, only submitting.

        He kissed her, kissed her eyes shut, so that she could not look any more. He wanted something now, some recognition, some sign, some admission. But she only lay silent and child-like and remote, like a child that is overcome and cannot understand, only feels lost. He kissed her again, giving up.

        ''Shall we go down and have coffee and Kuchen?'' he asked.

        The twilight was falling slate-blue at the window. She closed her eyes, closed away the monotonous level of dead wonder, and opened them again to the every-day world.

        ''Yes,'' she said briefly, regaining her will with a click. She went again to the window. Blue evening had fallen over the cradle of snow and over the great pallid slopes. But in the heaven the peaks of snow were rosy, glistening like transcendent, radiant spikes of blossom in the heavenly upper-world, so lovely and beyond.

        Gudrun saw all their loveliness, she KNEW how immortally beautiful they were, great pistils of rose-coloured, snow-fed fire in the blue twilight of the heaven. She could SEE it, she knew it, but she was not of it. She was divorced, debarred, a soul shut out.

        With a last look of remorse, she turned away, and was doing her hair. He had unstrapped the luggage, and was waiting, watching her. She knew he was watching her. It made her a little hasty and feverish in her precipitation.

        They went downstairs, both with a strange other-world look on their faces, and with a glow in their eyes. They saw Birkin and Ursula sitting at the long table in a corner, waiting for them.

        ''How good and simple they look together,'' Gudrun thought, jealously. She envied them some spontaneity, a childish sufficiency to which she herself could never approach. They seemed such children to her.

        ''Such good Kranzkuchen!'' cried Ursula greedily. ''So good!''

        ''Right,'' said Gudrun. ''Can we have Kaffee mit Kranzkuchen?'' she added to the waiter.

        And she seated herself on the bench beside Gerald. Birkin, looking at them, felt a pain of tenderness for them.

        ''I think the place is really wonderful, Gerald,'' he said; ''prachtvoll and wunderbar and wunderschon and unbeschreiblich and all the other German adjectives.''

        Gerald broke into a slight smile.

        ''I like it,'' he said.

        The tables, of white scrubbed wood, were placed round three sides of the room, as in a Gasthaus. Birkin and Ursula sat with their backs to the wall, which was of oiled wood, and Gerald and Gudrun sat in the corner next them, near to the stove. It was a fairly large place, with a tiny bar, just like a country inn, but quite simple and bare, and all of oiled wood, ceilings and walls and floor, the only furniture being the tables and benches going round three sides, the great green stove, and the bar and the doors on the fourth side. The windows were double, and quite uncurtained. It was early evening.

        The coffee came—hot and good—and a whole ring of cake.

        ''A whole Kuchen!'' cried Ursula. ''They give you more than us! I want some of yours.''

        There were other people in the place, ten altogether, so Birkin had found out: two artists, three students, a man and wife, and a Professor and two daughters—all Germans. The four English people, being newcomers, sat in their coign of vantage to watch. The Germans peeped in at the door, called a word to the waiter, and went away again. It was not meal-time, so they did not come into this dining-room, but betook themselves, when their boots were changed, to the Reunionsaal.

        The English visitors could hear the occasional twanging of a zither, the strumming of a piano, snatches of laughter and shouting and singing, a faint vibration of voices. The whole building being of wood, it seemed to carry every sound, like a drum, but instead of increasing each particular noise, it decreased it, so that the sound of the zither seemed tiny, as if a diminutive zither were playing somewhere, and it seemed the piano must be a small one, like a little spinet.

        The host came when the coffee was finished. He was a Tyrolese, broad, rather flat-cheeked, with a pale, pock-marked skin and flourishing moustaches.

        ''Would you like to go to the Reunionsaal to be introduced to the other ladies and gentlemen?'' he asked, bending forward and smiling, showing his large, strong teeth. His blue eyes went quickly from one to the other—he was not quite sure of his ground with these English people. He was unhappy too because he spoke no English and he was not sure whether to try his French.

        ''Shall we go to the Reunionsaal, and be introduced to the other people?'' repeated Gerald, laughing.

        There was a moment''s hesitation.

        ''I suppose we''d better—better break the ice,'' said Birkin.

        The women rose, rather flushed. And the Wirt''s black, beetle-like, broad-shouldered figure went on ignominiously in front, towards the noise. He opened the door and ushered the four strangers into the play-room.

        Instantly a silence fell, a slight embarrassment came over the company. The newcomers had a sense of many blond faces looking their way. Then, the host was bowing to a short, energetic-looking man with large moustaches, and saying in a low voice:

        ''Herr Professor, darf ich vorstellen-''

        The Herr Professor was prompt and energetic. He bowed low to the English people, smiling, and began to be a comrade at once.

        ''Nehmen die Herrschaften teil an unserer Unterhaltung?'' he said, with a vigorous suavity, his voice curling up in the question.

        The four English people smiled, lounging with an attentive uneasiness in the middle of the room. Gerald, who was spokesman, said that they would willingly take part in the entertainment. Gudrun and Ursula, laughing, excited, felt the eyes of all the men upon them, and they lifted their heads and looked nowhere, and felt royal.

        The Professor announced the names of those present, SANS CEREMONIE. There was a bowing to the wrong people and to the right people. Everybody was there, except the man and wife. The two tall, clear-skinned, athletic daughters of the professor, with their plain-cut, dark blue blouses and loden skirts, their rather long, strong necks, their clear blue eyes and carefully banded hair, and their blushes, bowed and stood back; the three students bowed very low, in the humble hope of making an impression of extreme good-breeding; then there was a thin, dark-skinned man with full eyes, an odd creature, like a child, and like a troll, quick, detached; he bowed slightly; his companion, a large fair young man, stylishly dressed, blushed to the eyes and bowed very low.

        It was over.

        ''Herr Loerke was giving us a recitation in the Cologne dialect,'' said the Professor.

        ''He must forgive us for interrupting him,'' said Gerald, ''we should like very much to hear it.''

        There was instantly a bowing and an offering of seats. Gudrun and Ursula, Gerald and Birkin sat in the deep sofas against the wall. The room was of naked oiled panelling, like the rest of the house. It had a piano, sofas and chairs, and a couple of tables with books and magazines. In its complete absence of decoration, save for the big, blue stove, it was cosy and pleasant.

        Herr Loerke was the little man with the boyish figure, and the round, full, sensitive-looking head, and the quick, full eyes, like a mouse''s. He glanced swiftly from one to the other of the strangers, and held himself aloof.

        ''Please go on with the recitation,'' said the Professor, suavely, with his slight authority. Loerke, who was sitting hunched on the piano stool, blinked and did not answer.

        ''It would be a great pleasure,'' said Ursula, who had been getting the sentence ready, in German, for some minutes.

        Then, suddenly, the small, unresponding man swung aside, towards his previous audience and broke forth, exactly as he had broken off; in a controlled, mocking voice, giving an imitation of a quarrel between an old Cologne woman and a railway guard.

        His body was slight and unformed, like a boy''s, but his voice was mature, sardonic, its movement had the flexibility of essential energy, and of a mocking penetrating understanding. Gudrun could not understand a word of his monologue, but she was spell-bound, watching him. He must be an artist, nobody else could have such fine adjustment and singleness. The Germans were doubled up with laughter, hearing his strange droll words, his droll phrases of dialect. And in the midst of their paroxysms, they glanced with deference at the four English strangers, the elect. Gudrun and Ursula were forced to laugh. The room rang with shouts of laughter. The blue eyes of the Professor''s daughters were swimming over with laughter-tears, their clear cheeks were flushed crimson with mirth, their father broke out in the most astonishing peals of hilarity, the students bowed their heads on their knees in excess of joy. Ursula looked round amazed, the laughter was bubbling out of her involuntarily. She looked at Gudrun. Gudrun looked at her, and the two sisters burst out laughing, carried away. Loerke glanced at them swiftly, with his full eyes. Birkin was s#@!%#$ing involuntarily. Gerald Crich sat erect, with a glistening look of amusement on his face. And the laughter crashed out again, in wild paroxysms, the Professor''s daughters were reduced to shaking helplessness, the veins of the Professor''s neck were swollen, his face was purple, he was strangled in ultimate, silent spasms of laughter. The students were shouting half-articulated words that tailed off in helpless explosions. Then suddenly the rapid patter of the artist ceased, there were little whoops of subsiding mirth, Ursula and Gudrun were wiping their eyes, and the Professor was crying loudly.

        ''Das war ausgezeichnet, das war famos—''

        ''Wirklich famos,'' echoed his exhausted daughters, faintly.

        ''And we couldn''t understand it,'' cried Ursula.

        ''Oh leider, leider!'' cried the Professor.

        ''You couldn''t understand it?'' cried the Students, let loose at last in speech with the newcomers. ''Ja, das ist wirklich schade, das ist schade, gnadige Frau. Wissen Sie—''

        The mixture was made, the newcomers were stirred into the party, like new ingredients, the whole room was alive. Gerald was in his element, he talked freely and excitedly, his face glistened with a strange amusement. Perhaps even Birkin, in the end, would break forth. He was shy and withheld, though full of attention.

        Ursula was prevailed upon to sing ''Annie Lowrie,'' as the Professor called it. There was a hush of EXTREME deference. She had never been so flattered in her life. Gudrun accompanied her on the piano, playing from memory.

        Ursula had a beautiful ringing voice, but usually no confidence, she spoiled everything. This evening she felt conceited and untrammelled. Birkin was well in the background, she shone almost in reaction, the Germans made her feel fine and infallible, she was liberated into overweening self-confidence. She felt like a bird flying in the air, as her voice soared out, enjoying herself extremely in the balance and flight of the song, like the motion of a bird''s wings that is up in the wind, sliding and playing on the air, she played with sentimentality, supported by rapturous attention. She was very happy, singing that song by herself, full of a conceit of emotion and power, working upon all those people, and upon herself, exerting herself with gratification, giving immeasurable gratification to the Germans.

        At the end, the Germans were all touched with admiring, delicious melancholy, they praised her in soft, reverent voices, they could not say too much.

        ''Wie schon, wie ruhrend! Ach, die Schottischen Lieder, sie haben so viel Stimmung! Aber die gnadige Frau hat eine WUNDERBARE Stimme; die gnadige Frau ist wirklich eine Kunstlerin, aber wirklich!''

        She was dilated and brilliant, like a flower in the morning sun. She felt Birkin looking at her, as if he were jealous of her, and her breasts thrilled, her veins were all golden. She was as happy as the sun that has just opened above clouds. And everybody seemed so admiring and radiant, it was perfect.

        After dinner she wanted to go out for a minute, to look at the world. The company tried to dissuade her—it was so terribly cold. But just to look, she said.

        They all four wrapped up warmly, and found themselves in a vague, unsubstantial outdoors of dim snow and ghosts of an upper-world, that made strange shadows before the stars. It was indeed cold, bruisingly, frighteningly, unnaturally cold. Ursula could not believe the air in her nostrils. It seemed conscious, malevolent, purposive in its intense murderous coldness.

        Yet it was wonderful, an intoxication, a silence of dim, unrealised snow, of the invisible intervening between her and the visible, between her and the flashing stars. She could see Orion sloping up. How wonderful he was, wonderful enough to make one cry aloud.

        And all around was this cradle of snow, and there was firm snow underfoot, that struck with heavy cold through her boot-soles. It was night, and silence. She imagined she could hear the stars. She imagined distinctly she could hear the celestial, musical motion of the stars, quite near at hand. She seemed like a bird flying amongst their harmonious motion.

        And she clung close to Birkin. Suddenly she realised she did not know what he was thinking. She did not know where he was ranging.

        ''My love!'' she said, stopping to look at him.

        His face was pale, his eyes dark, there was a faint spark of starlight on them. And he saw her face soft and upturned to him, very near. He kissed her softly.

        ''What then?'' he asked.

        ''Do you love me?'' she asked.

        ''Too much,'' he answered quietly.

        She clung a little closer.

        ''Not too much,'' she pleaded.

        ''Far too much,'' he said, almost sadly.

        ''And does it make you sad, that I am everything to you?'' she asked, wistful. He held her close to him, kissing her, and saying, scarcely audible:

        ''No, but I feel like a beggar—I feel poor.''

        She was silent, looking at the stars now. Then she kissed him.

        ''Don''t be a beggar,'' she pleaded, wistfully. ''It isn''t ignominious that you love me.''

        ''It is ignominious to feel poor, isn''t it?'' he replied.

        ''Why? Why should it be?'' she asked. He only stood still, in the terribly cold air that moved invisibly over the mountain tops, folding her round with his arms.

        ''I couldn''t bear this cold, eternal place without you,'' he said. ''I couldn''t bear it, it would kill the quick of my life.''

        She kissed him again, suddenly.

        ''Do you hate it?'' she asked, puzzled, wondering.

        ''If I couldn''t come near to you, if you weren''t here, I should hate it. I couldn''t bear it,'' he answered.

        ''But the people are nice,'' she said.

        ''I mean the stillness, the cold, the frozen eternality,'' he said.

        She wondered. Then her spirit came home to him, nestling unconscious in him.

        ''Yes, it is good we are warm and together,'' she said.

        And they turned home again. They saw the golden lights of the hotel glowing out in the night of snow-silence, small in the hollow, like a cluster of yellow berries. It seemed like a bunch of sun-sparks, tiny and orange in the midst of the snow-darkness. Behind, was a high shadow of a peak, blotting out the stars, like a ghost.

        They drew near to their home. They saw a man come from the dark building, with a lighted lantern which swung golden, and made that his dark feet walked in a halo of snow. He was a small, dark figure in the darkened snow. He unlatched the door of an outhouse. A smell of cows, hot, animal, almost like beef, came out on the heavily cold air. There was a glimpse of two cattle in their dark stalls, then the door was shut again, and not a chink of light showed. It had reminded Ursula again of home, of the Marsh, of her childhood, and of the journey to Brussels, and, strangely, of Anton Skrebensky.

        Oh, God, could one bear it, this past which was gone down the abyss? Could she bear, that it ever had been! She looked round this silent, upper world of snow and stars and powerful cold. There was another world, like views on a magic lantern; The Marsh, Cossethay, Ilkeston, lit up with a common, unreal light. There was a shadowy unreal Ursula, a whole shadow-play of an unreal life. It was as unreal, and circumscribed, as a magic-lantern show. She wished the slides could all be broken. She wished it could be gone for ever, like a lantern-slide which was broken. She wanted to have no past. She wanted to have come down from the slopes of heaven to this place, with Birkin, not to have toiled out of the murk of her childhood and her upbringing, slowly, all soiled. She felt that memory was a dirty trick played upon her. What was this decree, that she should ''remember''! Why not a bath of pure oblivion, a new birth, without any recollections or blemish of a past life. She was with Birkin, she had just come into life, here in the high snow, against the stars. What had she to do with parents and antecedents? She knew herself new and unbegotten, she had no father, no mother, no anterior connections, she was herself, pure and silvery, she belonged only to the oneness with Birkin, a oneness that struck deeper notes, sounding into the heart of the universe, the heart of reality, where she had never existed before.

        Even Gudrun was a separate unit, separate, separate, having nothing to do with this self, this Ursula, in her new world of reality. That old shadow-world, the actuality of the past—ah, let it go! She rose free on the wings of her new condition.

        Gudrun and Gerald had not come in. They had walked up the valley straight in front of the house, not like Ursula and Birkin, on to the little hill at the right. Gudrun was driven by a strange desire. She wanted to plunge on and on, till she came to the end of the valley of snow. Then she wanted to climb the wall of white finality, climb over, into the peaks that sprang up like sharp petals in the heart of the frozen, mysterious navel of the world. She felt that there, over the strange blind, terrible wall of rocky snow, there in the navel of the mystic world, among the final cluster of peaks, there, in the infolded navel of it all, was her consummation. If she could but come there, alone, and pass into the infolded navel of eternal snow and of uprising, immortal peaks of snow and rock, she would be a oneness with all, she would be herself the eternal, infinite silence, the sleeping, timeless, frozen centre of the All.

        They went back to the house, to the Reunionsaal. She was curious to see what was going on. The men there made her alert, roused her curiosity. It was a new taste of life for her, they were so prostrate before her, yet so full of life.

        The party was boisterous; they were dancing all together, dancing the Schuhplatteln, the Tyrolese dance of the clapping hands and tossing the partner in the air at the crisis. The Germans were all proficient—they were from Munich chiefly. Gerald also was quite passable. There were three zithers twanging away in a corner. It was a scene of great animation and confusion. The Professor was initiating Ursula into the dance, stamping, clapping, and swinging her high, with amazing force and zest. When the crisis came even Birkin was behaving manfully with one of the Professor''s fresh, strong daughters, who was exceedingly happy. Everybody was dancing, there was the most boisterous turmoil.

        Gudrun looked on with delight. The solid wooden floor resounded to the knocking heels of the men, the air quivered with the clapping hands and the zither music, there was a golden dust about the hanging lamps.

        Suddenly the dance finished, Loerke and the students rushed out to bring in drinks. There was an excited clamour of voices, a clinking of mug-lids, a great crying of ''Prosit—Prosit!'' Loerke was everywhere at once, like a gnome, suggesting drinks for the women, making an obscure, slightly risky joke with the men, confusing and mystifying the waiter.

        He wanted very much to dance with Gudrun. From the first moment he had seen her, he wanted to make a connection with her. Instinctively she felt this, and she waited for him to come up. But a kind of sulkiness kept him away from her, so she thought he disliked her.

        ''Will you schuhplatteln, gnadige Frau?'' said the large, fair youth, Loerke''s companion. He was too soft, too humble for Gudrun''s taste. But she wanted to dance, and the fair youth, who was called Leitner, was handsome enough in his uneasy, slightly abject fashion, a humility that covered a certain fear. She accepted him as a partner.

        The zithers sounded out again, the dance began. Gerald led them, laughing, with one of the Professor''s daughters. Ursula danced with one of the students, Birkin with the other daughter of the Professor, the Professor with Frau Kramer, and the rest of the men danced together, with quite as much zest as if they had had women partners.

        Because Gudrun had danced with the well-built, soft youth, his companion, Loerke, was more pettish and exasperated than ever, and would not even notice her existence in the room. This piqued her, but she made up to herself by dancing with the Professor, who was strong as a mature, well-seasoned bull, and as full of coarse energy. She could not bear him, critically, and yet she enjoyed being rushed through the dance, and tossed up into the air, on his coarse, powerful impetus. The Professor enjoyed it too, he eyed her with strange, large blue eyes, full of galvanic fire. She hated him for the seasoned, semi-paternal animalism with which he regarded her, but she admired his weight of strength.

        The room was charged with excitement and strong, animal emotion. Loerke was kept away from Gudrun, to whom he wanted to speak, as by a hedge of thorns, and he felt a sardonic ruthless hatred for this young love-companion, Leitner, who was his penniless dependent. He mocked the youth, with an acid ridicule, that made Leitner red in the face and impotent with resentment.

        Gerald, who had now got the dance perfectly, was dancing again with the younger of the Professor''s daughters, who was almost dying of virgin excitement, because she thought Gerald so handsome, so superb. He had her in his power, as if she were a palpitating bird, a fluttering, flushing, bewildered creature. And it made him smile, as she shrank convulsively between his hands, violently, when he must throw her into the air. At the end, she was so overcome with prostrate love for him, that she could scarcely speak sensibly at all.

        Birkin was dancing with Ursula. There were odd little fires playing in his eyes, he seemed to have turned into something wicked and flickering, mocking, suggestive, quite impossible. Ursula was frightened of him, and fascinated. Clear, before her eyes, as in a vision, she could see the sardonic, licentious mockery of his eyes, he moved towards her with subtle, animal, indifferent approach. The strangeness of his hands, which came quick and cunning, inevitably to the vital place beneath her breasts, and, lifting with mocking, suggestive impulse, carried her through the air as if without strength, through blackmagic, made her swoon with fear. For a moment she revolted, it was horrible. She would break the spell. But before the resolution had formed she had submitted again, yielded to her fear. He knew all the time what he was doing, she could see it in his smiling, concentrated eyes. It was his responsibility, she would leave it to him.

        When they were alone in the darkness, she felt the strange, licentiousness of him hovering upon her. She was troubled and repelled. Why should he turn like this?

        ''What is it?'' she asked in dread.

        But his face only glistened on her, unknown, horrible. And yet she was fascinated. Her impulse was to repel him violently, break from this spell of mocking brutishness. But she was too fascinated, she wanted to submit, she wanted to know. What would he do to her?

        He was so attractive, and so repulsive at one. The sardonic suggestivity that flickered over his face and looked from his narrowed eyes, made her want to hide, to hide herself away from him and watch him from somewhere unseen.

        ''Why are you like this?'' she demanded again, rousing against him with sudden force and animosity.

        The flickering fires in his eyes concentrated as he looked into her eyes. Then the lids drooped with a faint motion of satiric contempt. Then they rose again to the same remorseless suggestivity. And she gave way, he might do as he would. His licentiousness was repulsively attractive. But he was self-responsible, she would see what it was.

        They might do as they liked—this she realised as she went to sleep. How could anything that gave one satisfaction be excluded? What was degrading? Who cared? Degrading things were real, with a different reality. And he was so unabashed and unrestrained. Wasn''t it rather horrible, a man who could be so soulful and spiritual, now to be so—she balked at her own thoughts and memories: then she added—so bestial? So bestial, they two!—so degraded! She winced. But after all, why not? She exulted as well. Why not be bestial, and go the whole round of experience? She exulted in it. She was bestial. How good it was to be really shameful! There would be no shameful thing she had not experienced. Yet she was unabashed, she was herself. Why not? She was free, when she knew everything, and no dark shameful things were denied her.

        Gudrun, who had been watching Gerald in the Reunionsaal, suddenly thought:

        ''He should have all the women he can—it is his nature. It is absurd to call him monogamous—he is naturally promiscuous. That is his nature.''

        The thought came to her involuntarily. It shocked her somewhat. It was as if she had seen some new MENE! MENE! upon the wall. Yet it was merely true. A voice seemed to have spoken it to her so clearly, that for the moment she believed in inspiration.

        ''It is really true,'' she said to herself again.

        She knew quite well she had believed it all along. She knew it implicitly. But she must keep it dark—almost from herself. She must keep it completely secret. It was knowledge for her alone, and scarcely even to be admitted to herself.

        The deep resolve formed in her, to combat him. One of them must triumph over the other. Which should it be? Her soul steeled itself with strength. Almost she laughed within herself, at her confidence. It woke a certain keen, half contemptuous pity, tenderness for him: she was so ruthless.

        Everybody retired early. The Professor and Loerke went into a small lounge to drink. They both watched Gudrun go along the landing by the railing upstairs.

        ''Ein schones Frauenzimmer,'' said the Professor.

        ''Ja!'' asserted Loerke, shortly.

        Gerald walked with his queer, long wolf-steps across the bedroom to the window, stooped and looked out, then rose again, and turned to Gudrun, his eyes sharp with an abstract smile. He seemed very tall to her, she saw the glisten of his whitish eyebrows, that met between his brows.

        ''How do you like it?'' he said.

        He seemed to be laughing inside himself, quite unconsciously. She looked at him. He was a phenomenon to her, not a human being: a sort of creature, greedy.

        ''I like it very much,'' she replied.

        ''Who do you like best downstairs?'' he asked, standing tall and glistening above her, with his glistening stiff hair erect.

        ''Who do I like best?'' she repeated, wanting to answer his question, and finding it difficult to collect herself. ''Why I don''t know, I don''t know enough about them yet, to be able to say. Who do YOU like best?''

        ''Oh, I don''t care—I don''t like or dislike any of them. It doesn''t matter about me. I wanted to know about you.''

        ''But why?'' she asked, going rather pale. The abstract, unconscious smile in his eyes was intensified.

        ''I wanted to know,'' he said.

        She turned aside, breaking the spell. In some strange way, she felt he was getting power over her.

        ''Well, I can''t tell you already,'' she said.

        She went to the mirror to take out the hairpins from her hair. She stood before the mirror every night for some minutes, brushing her fine dark hair. It was part of the inevitable ritual of her life.

        He followed her, and stood behind her. She was busy with bent head, taking out the pins and shaking her warm hair loose. When she looked up, she saw him in the glass standing behind her, watching unconsciously, not consciously seeing her, and yet watching, with finepupilled eyes that SEEMED to smile, and which were not really smiling.

        She started. It took all her courage for her to continue brushing her hair, as usual, for her to pretend she was at her ease. She was far, far from being at her ease with him. She beat her brains wildly for something to say to him.

        ''What are your plans for tomorrow?'' she asked nonchalantly, whilst her heart was beating so furiously, her eyes were so bright with strange nervousness, she felt he could not but observe. But she knew also that he was completely blind, blind as a wolf looking at her. It was a strange battle between her ordinary consciousness and his uncanny, black-art consciousness.

        ''I don''t know,'' he replied, ''what would you like to do?''

        He spoke emptily, his mind was sunk away.

        ''Oh,'' she said, with easy protestation, ''I''m ready for anything—anything will be fine for ME, I''m sure.''

        And to herself she was saying: ''God, why am I so nervous—why are you so nervous, you fool. If he sees it I''m done for forever—you KNOW you''re done for forever, if he sees the absurd state you''re in.''

        And she smiled to herself as if it were all child''s play. Meanwhile her heart was plunging, she was almost fainting. She could see him, in the mirror, as he stood there behind her, tall and over-arching—blond and terribly frightening. She glanced at his reflection with furtive eyes, willing to give anything to save him from knowing she could see him. He did not know she could see his reflection. He was looking unconsciously, glisteningly down at her head, from which the hair fell loose, as she brushed it with wild, nervous hand. She held her head aside and brushed and brushed her hair madly. For her life, she could not turn round and face him. For her life, SHE COULD NOT. And the knowledge made her almost sink to the ground in a faint, helpless, spent. She was aware of his frightening, impending figure standing close behind her, she was aware of his hard, strong, unyielding chest, close upon her back. And she felt she could not bear it any more, in a few minutes she would fall down at his feet, grovelling at his feet, and letting him destroy her.

        The thought pricked up all her sharp intelligence and presence of mind. She dared not turn round to him—and there he stood motionless, unbroken. Summoning all her strength, she said, in a full, resonant, nonchalant voice, that was forced out with all her remaining self-control:

        ''Oh, would you mind looking in that bag behind there and giving me my—''

        Here her power fell inert. ''My what—my what—?'' she screamed in silence to herself.

        But he had started round, surprised and startled that she should ask him to look in her bag, which she always kept so VERY private to herself.

        She turned now, her face white, her dark eyes blazing with uncanny, overwrought excitement. She saw him stooping to the bag, undoing the loosely buckled strap, unattentive.

        ''Your what?'' he asked.

        ''Oh, a little enamel box—yellow—with a design of a cormorant plucking her breast—''

        She went towards him, stooping her beautiful, bare arm, and deftly turned some of her things, disclosing the box, which was exquisitely painted.

        ''That is it, see,'' she said, taking it from under his eyes.

        And he was baffled now. He was left to fasten up the bag, whilst she swiftly did up her hair for the night, and sat down to unfasten her shoes. She would not turn her back to him any more.

        He was baffled, frustrated, but unconscious. She had the whip hand over him now. She knew he had not realised her terrible panic. Her heart was beating heavily still. Fool, fool that she was, to get into such a state! How she thanked God for Gerald''s obtuse blindness. Thank God he could see nothing.

        She sat slowly unlacing her shoes, and he too commenced to undress. Thank God that crisis was over. She felt almost fond of him now, almost in love with him.

        ''Ah, Gerald,'' she laughed, caressively, teasingly, ''Ah, what a fine game you played with the Professor''s daughter—didn''t you now?''

        ''What game?'' he asked, looking round.

        ''ISN''T she in love with you—oh DEAR, isn''t she in love with you!'' said Gudrun, in her gayest, most attractive mood.

        ''I shouldn''t think so,'' he said.

        ''Shouldn''t think so!'' she teased. ''Why the poor girl is lying at this moment overwhelmed, dying with love for you. She thinks you''re WONDERFUL—oh marvellous, beyond what man has ever been. REALLY, isn''t it funny?''

        ''Why funny, what is funny?'' he asked.

        ''Why to see you working it on her,'' she said, with a half reproach that confused the male conceit in him. ''Really Gerald, the poor girl—!''

        ''I did nothing to her,'' he said.

        ''Oh, it was too shameful, the way you simply swept her off her feet.''

        ''That was Schuhplatteln,'' he replied, with a bright grin.

        ''Ha—ha—ha!'' laughed Gudrun.

        Her mockery quivered through his muscles with curious re-echoes. When he slept he seemed to crouch down in the bed, lapped up in his own strength, that yet was hollow.

        And Gudrun slept strongly, a victorious sleep. Suddenly, she was almost fiercely awake. The small timber room glowed with the dawn, that came upwards from the low window. She could see down the valley when she lifted her head: the snow with a pinkish, half-revealed magic, the fringe of pine-trees at the bottom of the slope. And one tiny figure moved over the vaguely-illuminated space.

        She glanced at his watch; it was seven o''clock. He was still completely asleep. And she was so hard awake, it was almost frightening—a hard, metallic wakefulness. She lay looking at him.

        He slept in the subjection of his own health and defeat. She was overcome by a sincere regard for him. Till now, she was afraid before him. She lay and thought about him, what he was, what he represented in the world. A fine, independent will, he had. She thought of the revolution he had worked in the mines, in so short a time. She knew that, if he were confronted with any problem, any hard actual difficulty, he would overcome it. If he laid hold of any idea, he would carry it through. He had the faculty of making order out of confusion. Only let him grip hold of a situation, and he would bring to pass an inevitable conclusion.

        For a few moments she was borne away on the wild wings of ambition. Gerald, with his force of will and his power for comprehending the actual world, should be set to solve the problems of the day, the problem of industrialism in the modern world. She knew he would, in the course of time, effect the changes he desired, he could re-organise the industrial system. She knew he could do it. As an instrument, in these things, he was marvellous, she had never seen any man with his potentiality. He was unaware of it, but she knew.

        He only needed to be hitched on, he needed that his hand should be set to the task, because he was so unconscious. And this she could do. She would marry him, he would go into Parliament in the Conservative interest, he would clear up the great muddle of labour and industry. He was so superbly fearless, masterful, he knew that every problem could be worked out, in life as in geometry. And he would care neither about himself nor about anything but the pure working out of the problem. He was very pure, really.

        Her heart beat fast, she flew away on wings of elation, imagining a future. He would be a Napoleon of peace, or a Bismarck—and she the woman behind him. She had read Bismarck''s letters, and had been deeply moved by them. And Gerald would be freer, more dauntless than Bismarck.

        But even as she lay in fictitious transport, bathed in the strange, false sunshine of hope in life, something seemed to snap in her, and a terrible cynicism began to gain upon her, blowing in like a wind. Everything turned to irony with her: the last flavour of everything was ironical. When she felt her pang of undeniable reality, this was when she knew the hard irony of hopes and ideas.

        She lay and looked at him, as he slept. He was sheerly beautiful, he was a perfect instrument. To her mind, he was a pure, inhuman, almost superhuman instrument. His instrumentality appealed so strongly to her, she wished she were God, to use him as a tool.

        And at the same instant, came the ironical question: ''What for?'' She thought of the colliers'' wives, with their linoleum and their lace curtains and their little girls in high-laced boots. She thought of the wives and daughters of the pit-managers, their tennis-parties, and their terrible struggles to be superior each to the other, in the social scale. There was Shortlands with its meaningless distinction, the meaningless crowd of the Criches. There was London, the House of Commons, the extant social world. My God!

        Young as she was, Gudrun had touched the whole pulse of social England. She had no ideas of rising in the world. She knew, with the perfect cynicism of cruel youth, that to rise in the world meant to have one outside show instead of another, the advance was like having a spurious half-crown instead of a spurious penny. The whole coinage of valuation was spurious. Yet of course, her cynicism knew well enough that, in a world where spurious coin was current, a bad sovereign was better than a bad farthing. But rich and poor, she despised both alike.

        Already she mocked at herself for her dreams. They could be fulfilled easily enough. But she recognised too well, in her spirit, the mockery of her own impulses. What did she care, that Gerald had created a richly-paying industry out of an old worn-out concern? What did she care? The worn-out concern and the rapid, splendidly organised industry, they were bad money. Yet of course, she cared a great deal, outwardly—and outwardly was all that mattered, for inwardly was a bad joke.

        Everything was intrinsically a piece of irony to her. She leaned over Gerald and said in her heart, with compassion:

        ''Oh, my dear, my dear, the game isn''t worth even you. You are a fine thing really—why should you be used on such a poor show!''

        Her heart was breaking with pity and grief for him. And at the same moment, a grimace came over her mouth, of mocking irony at her own unspoken tirade. Ah, what a farce it was! She thought of Parnell and Katherine O''Shea. Parnell! After all, who can take the nationalisation of Ireland seriously? Who can take political Ireland really seriously, whatever it does? And who can take political England seriously? Who can? Who can care a straw, really, how the old patched-up Constitution is tinkered at any more? Who cares a button for our national ideas, any more than for our national bowler hat? Aha, it is all old hat, it is all old bowler hat!

        That''s all it is, Gerald, my young hero. At any rate we''ll spare ourselves the nausea of stirring the old broth any more. You be beautiful, my Gerald, and reckless. There ARE perfect moments. Wake up, Gerald, wake up, convince me of the perfect moments. Oh, convince me, I need it.

        He opened his eyes, and looked at her. She greeted him with a mocking, enigmatic smile in which was a poignant gaiety. Over his face went the reflection of the smile, he smiled, too, purely unconsciously.

        That filled her with extraordinary delight, to see the smile cross his face, reflected from her face. She remembered that was how a baby smiled. It filled her with extraordinary radiant delight.

        ''You''ve done it,'' she said.

        ''What?'' he asked, dazed.

        ''Convinced me.''

        And she bent down, kissing him passionately, passionately, so that he was bewildered. He did not ask her of what he had convinced her, though he meant to. He was glad she was kissing him. She seemed to be feeling for his very heart to touch the quick of him. And he wanted her to touch the quick of his being, he wanted that most of all.

        Outside, somebody was singing, in a manly, reckless handsome voice:

        ''Mach mir auf, mach mir auf, du Stolze,
Mach mir ein Feuer von Holze.
Vom Regen bin ich nass
Vom Regen bin ich nass-''

        Gudrun knew that that song would sound through her eternity, sung in a manly, reckless, mocking voice. It marked one of her supreme moments, the supreme pangs of her nervous gratification. There it was, fixed in eternity for her.

        The day came fine and bluish. There was a light wind blowing among the mountain tops, keen as a rapier where it touched, carrying with it a fine dust of snow-powder. Gerald went out with the fine, blind face of a man who is in his state of fulfilment. Gudrun and he were in perfect static unity this morning, but unseeing and unwitting. They went out with a toboggan, leaving Ursula and Birkin to follow.

        Gudrun was all scarlet and royal blue—a scarlet jersey and cap, and a royal blue skirt and stockings. She went gaily over the white snow, with Gerald beside her, in white and grey, pulling the little toboggan. They grew small in the distance of snow, climbing the steep slope.

        For Gudrun herself, she seemed to pass altogether into the whiteness of the snow, she became a pure, thoughtless crystal. When she reached the top of the slope, in the wind, she looked round, and saw peak beyond peak of rock and snow, bluish, transcendent in heaven. And it seemed to her like a garden, with the peaks for pure flowers, and her heart gathering them. She had no separate consciousness for Gerald.

        She held on to him as they went sheering down over the keen slope. She felt as if her senses were being whetted on some fine grindstone, that was keen as flame. The snow sprinted on either side, like sparks from a blade that is being sharpened, the whiteness round about ran swifter, swifter, in pure flame the white slope flew against her, and she fused like one molten, dancing globule, rushed through a white intensity. Then there was a great swerve at the bottom, when they swung as it were in a fall to earth, in the diminishing motion.

        They came to rest. But when she rose to her feet, she could not stand. She gave a strange cry, turned and clung to him, sinking her face on his breast, fainting in him. Utter oblivion came over her, as she lay for a few moments abandoned against him.

        ''What is it?'' he was saying. ''Was it too much for you?''

        But she heard nothing.

        When she came to, she stood up and looked round, astonished. Her face was white, her eyes brilliant and large.

        ''What is it?'' he repeated. ''Did it upset you?''

        She looked at him with her brilliant eyes that seemed to have undergone some transfiguration, and she laughed, with a terrible merriment.

        ''No,'' she cried, with triumphant joy. ''It was the complete moment of my life.''

        And she looked at him with her dazzling, overweening laughter, like one possessed. A fine blade seemed to enter his heart, but he did not care, or take any notice.

        But they climbed up the slope again, and they flew down through the white flame again, splendidly, splendidly. Gudrun was laughing and flashing, powdered with snow-crystals, Gerald worked perfectly. He felt he could guide the toboggan to a hair-breadth, almost he could make it pierce into the air and right into the very heart of the sky. It seemed to him the flying sledge was but his strength spread out, he had but to move his arms, the motion was his own. They explored the great slopes, to find another slide. He felt there must be something better than they had known. And he found what he desired, a perfect long, fierce sweep, sheering past the foot of a rock and into the trees at the base. It was dangerous, he knew. But then he knew also he would direct the sledge between his fingers.

        The first days passed in an ecstasy of physical motion, sleighing, skiing, skating, moving in an intensity of speed and white light that surpassed life itself, and carried the souls of the human beings beyond into an inhuman abstraction of velocity and weight and eternal, frozen snow.

        Gerald''s eyes became hard and strange, and as he went by on his skis he was more like some powerful, fateful sigh than a man, his muscles elastic in a perfect, soaring trajectory, his body projected in pure flight, mindless, soulless, whirling along one perfect line of force.

        Luckily there came a day of snow, when they must all stay indoors: otherwise Birkin said, they would all lose their faculties, and begin to utter themselves in cries and shrieks, like some strange, unknown species of snow-creatures.

        It happened in the afternoon that Ursula sat in the Reunionsaal talking to Loerke. The latter had seemed unhappy lately. He was lively and full of mischievous humour, as usual.

        But Ursula had thought he was sulky about something. His partner, too, the big, fair, good-looking youth, was ill at ease, going about as if he belonged to nowhere, and was kept in some sort of subjection, against which he was rebelling.

        Loerke had hardly talked to Gudrun. His associate, on the other hand, had paid her constantly a soft, over-deferential attention. Gudrun wanted to talk to Loerke. He was a sculptor, and she wanted to hear his view of his art. And his figure attracted her. There was the look of a little wastrel about him, that intrigued her, and an old man''s look, that interested her, and then, beside this, an uncanny singleness, a quality of being by himself, not in contact with anybody else, that marked out an artist to her. He was a chatterer, a magpie, a maker of mischievous word-jokes, that were sometimes very clever, but which often were not. And she could see in his brown, gnome''s eyes, the black look of inorganic misery, which lay behind all his small buffoonery.

        His figure interested her—the figure of a boy, almost a street arab. He made no attempt to conceal it. He always wore a simple loden suit, with knee breeches. His legs were thin, and he made no attempt to disguise the fact: which was of itself remarkable, in a German. And he never ingratiated himself anywhere, not in the slightest, but kept to himself, for all his apparent playfulness.

        Leitner, his companion, was a great sportsman, very handsome with his big limbs and his blue eyes. Loerke would go toboganning or skating, in little snatches, but he was indifferent. And his fine, thin nostrils, the nostrils of a pure-bred street arab, would quiver with contempt at Leitner''s splothering gymnastic displays. It was evident that the two men who had travelled and lived together, sharing the same bedroom, had now reached the stage of loathing. Leitner hated Loerke with an injured, writhing, impotent hatred, and Loerke treated Leitner with a fine-quivering contempt and sarcasm. Soon the two would have to go apart.

        Already they were rarely together. Leitner ran attaching himself to somebody or other, always deferring, Loerke was a good deal alone. Out of doors he wore a Westphalian cap, a close brown-velvet head with big brown velvet flaps down over his ears, so that he looked like a lop-eared rabbit, or a troll. His face was brown-red, with a dry, bright skin, that seemed to crinkle with his mobile expressions. His eyes were arresting—brown, full, like a rabbit''s, or like a troll''s, or like the eyes of a lost being, having a strange, dumb, depraved look of knowledge, and a quick spark of uncanny fire. Whenever Gudrun had tried to talk to him he had shied away unresponsive, looking at her with his watchful dark eyes, but entering into no relation with her. He had made her feel that her slow French and her slower German, were hateful to him. As for his own inadequate English, he was much too awkward to try it at all. But he understood a good deal of what was said, nevertheless. And Gudrun, piqued, left him alone.

        This afternoon, however, she came into the lounge as he was talking to Ursula. His fine, black hair somehow reminded her of a bat, thin as it was on his full, sensitive-looking head, and worn away at the temples. He sat hunched up, as if his spirit were bat-like. And Gudrun could see he was making some slow confidence to Ursula, unwilling, a slow, grudging, scanty self-revelation. She went and sat by her sister.

        He looked at her, then looked away again, as if he took no notice of her. But as a matter of fact, she interested him deeply.

        ''Isn''t it interesting, Prune,'' said Ursula, turning to her sister, ''Herr Loerke is doing a great frieze for a factory in Cologne, for the outside, the street.''

        She looked at him, at his thin, brown, nervous hands, that were prehensile, and somehow like talons, like ''griffes,'' inhuman.

        ''What IN?'' she asked.

        ''AUS WAS?'' repeated Ursula.

        ''GRANIT,'' he replied.

        It had become immediately a laconic series of question and answer between fellow craftsmen.

        ''What is the relief?'' asked Gudrun.

        ''Alto relievo.''

        ''And at what height?''

        It was very interesting to Gudrun to think of his making the great granite frieze for a great granite factory in Cologne. She got from him some notion of the design. It was a representation of a fair, with peasants and artisans in an orgy of enjoyment, drunk and absurd in their modern dress, whirling ridiculously in roundabouts, gaping at shows, kissing and staggering and rolling in knots, swinging in swing-boats, and firing down shooting galleries, a frenzy of chaotic motion.

        There was a swift discussion of technicalities. Gudrun was very much impressed.

        ''But how wonderful, to have such a factory!'' cried Ursula. ''Is the whole building fine?''

        ''Oh yes,'' he replied. ''The frieze is part of the whole architecture. Yes, it is a colossal thing.''

        Then he seemed to stiffen, shrugged his shoulders, and went on:

        ''Sculpture and architecture must go together. The day for irrelevant statues, as for wall pictures, is over. As a matter of fact sculpture is always part of an architectural conception. And since churches are all museum stuff, since industry is our business, now, then let us make our places of industry our art—our factory-area our Parthenon, ECCO!''

        Ursula pondered.

        ''I suppose,'' she said, ''there is no NEED for our great works to be so hideous.''

        Instantly he broke into motion.

        ''There you are!'' he cried, ''there you are! There is not only NO NEED for our places of work to be ugly, but their ugliness ruins the work, in the end. Men will not go on submitting to such intolerable ugliness. In the end it will hurt too much, and they will wither because of it. And this will wither the WORK as well. They will think the work itself is ugly: the machines, the very act of labour. Whereas the machinery and the acts of labour are extremely, maddeningly beautiful. But this will be the end of our civilisation, when people will not work because work has become so intolerable to their senses, it nauseates them too much, they would rather starve. THEN we shall see the hammer used only for smashing, then we shall see it. Yet here we are—we have the opportunity to make beautiful factories, beautiful machine-houses—we have the opportunity—''

        Gudrun could only partly understand. She could have cried with vexation.

        ''What does he say?'' she asked Ursula. And Ursula translated, stammering and brief. Loerke watched Gudrun''s face, to see her judgment.

        ''And do you think then,'' said Gudrun, ''that art should serve industry?''

        ''Art should INTERPRET industry, as art once interpreted religion,'' he said.

        ''But does your fair interpret industry?'' she asked him.

        ''Certainly. What is man doing, when he is at a fair like this? He is fulfilling the counterpart of labour—the machine works him, instead of he the machine. He enjoys the mechanical motion, in his own body.''

        ''But is there nothing but work—mechanical work?'' said Gudrun.

        ''Nothing but work!'' he repeated, leaning forward, his eyes two darknesses, with needle-points of light. ''No, it is nothing but this, serving a machine, or enjoying the motion of a machine—motion, that is all. You have never worked for hunger, or you would know what god governs us.''

        Gudrun quivered and flushed. For some reason she was almost in tears.

        ''No, I have not worked for hunger,'' she replied, ''but I have worked!''

        ''Travaille—lavorato?'' he asked. ''E che lavoro—che lavoro? Quel travail est-ce que vous avez fait?''

        He broke into a mixture of Italian and French, instinctively using a foreign language when he spoke to her.

        ''You have never worked as the world works,'' he said to her, with sarcasm.

        ''Yes,'' she said. ''I have. And I do—I work now for my daily bread.''

        He paused, looked at her steadily, then dropped the subject entirely. She seemed to him to be trifling.

        ''But have YOU ever worked as the world works?'' Ursula asked him.

        He looked at her untrustful.

        ''Yes,'' he replied, with a surly bark. ''I have known what it was to lie in bed for three days, because I had nothing to eat.''

        Gudrun was looking at him with large, grave eyes, that seemed to draw the confession from him as the marrow from his bones. All his nature held him back from confessing. And yet her large, grave eyes upon him seemed to open some valve in his veins, and involuntarily he was telling.

        ''My father was a man who did not like work, and we had no mother. We lived in Austria, Polish Austria. How did we live? Ha!—somehow! Mostly in a room with three other families—one set in each corner—and the W.C. in the middle of the room—a pan with a plank on it—ha! I had two brothers and a sister—and there might be a woman with my father. He was a free being, in his way—would fight with any man in the town—a garrison town—and was a little man too. But he wouldn''t work for anybody—set his heart against it, and wouldn''t.''

        ''And how did you live then?'' asked Ursula.

        He looked at her—then, suddenly, at Gudrun.

        ''Do you understand?'' he asked.

        ''Enough,'' she replied.

        Their eyes met for a moment. Then he looked away. He would say no more.

        ''And how did you become a sculptor?'' asked Ursula.

        ''How did I become a sculptor—'' he paused. ''Dunque—'' he resumed, in a changed manner, and beginning to speak French—''I became old enough—I used to steal from the market-place. Later I went to work—imprinted the stamp on clay bottles, before they were baked. It was an earthenware-bottle factory. There I began making models. One day, I had had enough. I lay in the sun and did not go to work. Then I walked to Munich—then I walked to Italy—begging, begging everything.''

        ''The Italians were very good to me—they were good and honourable to me. From Bozen to Rome, almost every night I had a meal and a bed, perhaps of straw, with some peasant. I love the Italian people, with all my heart.

        ''Dunque, adesso—maintenant—I earn a thousand pounds in a year, or I earn two thousand—''

        He looked down at the ground, his voice tailing off into silence.

        Gudrun looked at his fine, thin, shiny skin, reddish-brown from the sun, drawn tight over his full temples; and at his thin hair—and at the thick, coarse, brush-like moustache, cut short about his mobile, rather shapeless mouth.

        ''How old are you?'' she asked.

        He looked up at her with his full, elfin eyes startled.

        ''WIE ALT?'' he repeated. And he hesitated. It was evidently one of his reticencies.

        ''How old are YOU?'' he replied, without answering.

        ''I am twenty-six,'' she answered.

        ''Twenty-six,'' he repeated, looking into her eyes. He paused. Then he said:

        ''UND IHR HERR GEMAHL, WIE ALT IS ER?''

        ''Who?'' asked Gudrun.

        ''Your husband,'' said Ursula, with a certain irony.

        ''I haven''t got a husband,'' said Gudrun in English. In German she answered,

        ''He is thirty-one.''

        But Loerke was watching closely, with his uncanny, full, suspicious eyes. Something in Gudrun seemed to accord with him. He was really like one of the ''little people'' who have no soul, who has found his mate in a human being. But he suffered in his discovery. She too was fascinated by him, fascinated, as if some strange creature, a rabbit or a bat, or a brown seal, had begun to talk to her. But also, she knew what he was unconscious of, his tremendous power of understanding, of apprehending her living motion. He did not know his own power. He did not know how, with his full, submerged, watchful eyes, he could look into her and see her, what she was, see her secrets. He would only want her to be herself—he knew her verily, with a subconscious, sinister knowledge, devoid of illusions and hopes.

        To Gudrun, there was in Loerke the rock-bottom of all life. Everybody else had their illusion, must have their illusion, their before and after. But he, with a perfect stoicism, did without any before and after, dispensed with all illusion. He did not deceive himself in the last issue. In the last issue he cared about nothing, he was troubled about nothing, he made not the slightest attempt to be at one with anything. He existed a pure, unconnected will, stoical and momentaneous. There was only his work.

        It was curious too, how his poverty, the degradation of his earlier life, attracted her. There was something insipid and tasteless to her, in the idea of a gentleman, a man who had gone the usual course through school and university. A certain violent sympathy, however, came up in her for this mud-child. He seemed to be the very stuff of the underworld of life. There was no going beyond him.

        Ursula too was attracted by Loerke. In both sisters he commanded a certain homage. But there were moments when to Ursula he seemed indescribably inferior, false, a vulgarism.

        Both Birkin and Gerald disliked him, Gerald ignoring him with some contempt, Birkin exasperated.

        ''What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?'' Gerald asked.

        ''God alone knows,'' replied Birkin, ''unless it''s some sort of appeal he makes to them, which flatters them and has such a power over them.''

        Gerald looked up in surprise.

        ''DOES he make an appeal to them?'' he asked.

        ''Oh yes,'' replied Birkin. ''He is the perfectly subjected being, existing almost like a criminal. And the women rush towards that, like a current of air towards a vacuum.''

        ''Funny they should rush to that,'' said Gerald.

        ''Makes one mad, too,'' said Birkin. ''But he has the fascination of pity and repulsion for them, a little obscene monster of the darkness that he is.''

        Gerald stood still, suspended in thought.

        ''What DO women want, at the bottom?'' he asked.

        Birkin shrugged his shoulders.

        ''God knows,'' he said. ''Some satisfaction in basic repulsion, it seems to me. They seem to creep down some ghastly tunnel of darkness, and will never be satisfied till they''ve come to the end.''

        Gerald looked out into the mist of fine snow that was blowing by. Everywhere was blind today, horribly blind.

        ''And what is the end?'' he asked.

        Birkin shook his head.

        ''I''ve not got there yet, so I don''t know. Ask Loerke, he''s pretty near. He is a good many stages further than either you or I can go.''

        ''Yes, but stages further in what?'' cried Gerald, irritated.

        Birkin sighed, and gathered his brows into a knot of anger.

        ''Stages further in social hatred,'' he said. ''He lives like a rat, in the river of corruption, just where it falls over into the bottomless pit. He''s further on than we are. He hates the ideal more acutely. He HATES the ideal utterly, yet it still dominates him. I expect he is a Jew—or part Jewish.''

        ''Probably,'' said Gerald.

        ''He is a gnawing little negation, gnawing at the roots of life.''

        ''But why does anybody care about him?'' cried Gerald.

        ''Because they hate the ideal also, in their souls. They want to explore the sewers, and he''s the wizard rat that swims ahead.''

        Still Gerald stood and stared at the blind haze of snow outside.

        ''I don''t understand your terms, really,'' he said, in a flat, doomed voice. ''But it sounds a rum sort of desire.''

        ''I suppose we want the same,'' said Birkin. ''Only we want to take a quick jump downwards, in a sort of ecstasy—and he ebbs with the stream, the sewer stream.''

        Meanwhile Gudrun and Ursula waited for the next opportunity to talk to Loerke. It was no use beginning when the men were there. Then they could get into no touch with the isolated little sculptor. He had to be alone with them. And he preferred Ursula to be there, as a sort of transmitter to Gudrun.

        ''Do you do nothing but architectural sculpture?'' Gudrun asked him one evening.

        ''Not now,'' he replied. ''I have done all sorts—except portraits—I never did portraits. But other things—''

        ''What kind of things?'' asked Gudrun.

        He paused a moment, then rose, and went out of the room. He returned almost immediately with a little roll of paper, which he handed to her. She unrolled it. It was a photogravure reproduction of a statuette, signed F. Loerke.

        ''That is quite an early thing—NOT mechanical,'' he said, ''more popular.''

        The statuette was of a naked girl, small, finely made, sitting on a great naked horse. The girl was young and tender, a mere bud. She was sitting sideways on the horse, her face in her hands, as if in shame and grief, in a little abandon. Her hair, which was short and must be flaxen, fell forward, divided, half covering her hands.

        Her limbs were young and tender. Her legs, scarcely formed yet, the legs of a maiden just passing towards cruel womanhood, dangled childishly over the side of the powerful horse, pathetically, the small feet folded one over the other, as if to hide. But there was no hiding. There she was exposed naked on the naked flank of the horse.

        The horse stood stock still, stretched in a kind of start. It was a massive, magnificent stallion, rigid with pent-up power. Its neck was arched and terrible, like a sickle, its flanks were pressed back, rigid with power.

        Gudrun went pale, and a darkness came over her eyes, like shame, she looked up with a certain supplication, almost slave-like. He glanced at her, and jerked his head a little.

        ''How big is it?'' she asked, in a toneless voice, persisting in appearing casual and unaffected.

        ''How big?'' he replied, glancing again at her. ''Without pedestal—so high—'' he measured with his hand—''with pedestal, so—''

        He looked at her steadily. There was a little brusque, turgid contempt for her in his swift gesture, and she seemed to cringe a little.

        ''And what is it done in?'' she asked, throwing back her head and looking at him with affected coldness.

        He still gazed at her steadily, and his dominance was not shaken.

        ''Bronze—green bronze.''

        ''Green bronze!'' repeated Gudrun, coldly accepting his challenge. She was thinking of the slender, immature, tender limbs of the girl, smooth and cold in green bronze.

        ''Yes, beautiful,'' she murmured, looking up at him with a certain dark homage.

        He closed his eyes and looked aside, triumphant.

        ''Why,'' said Ursula, ''did you make the horse so stiff? It is as stiff as a block.''

        ''Stiff?'' he repeated, in arms at once.

        ''Yes. LOOK how stock and stupid and brutal it is. Horses are sensitive, quite delicate and sensitive, really.''

        He raised his shoulders, spread his hands in a shrug of slow indifference, as much as to inform her she was an amateur and an impertinent nobody.

        ''Wissen Sie,'' he said, with an insulting patience and condescension in his voice, ''that horse is a certain FORM, part of a whole form. It is part of a work of art, a piece of form. It is not a picture of a friendly horse to which you give a lump of sugar, do you see—it is part of a work of art, it has no relation to anything outside that work of art.''

        Ursula, angry at being treated quite so insultingly DE HAUT EN BAS, from the height of esoteric art to the depth of general exoteric amateurism, replied, hotly, flushing and lifting her face.

        ''But it IS a picture of a horse, nevertheless.''

        He lifted his shoulders in another shrug.

        ''As you like—it is not a picture of a cow, certainly.''

        Here Gudrun broke in, flushed and brilliant, anxious to avoid any more of this, any more of Ursula''s foolish persistence in giving herself away.

        ''What do you mean by "it is a picture of a horse?"'' she cried at her sister. ''What do you mean by a horse? You mean an idea you have in YOUR head, and which you want to see represented. There is another idea altogether, quite another idea. Call it a horse if you like, or say it is not a horse. I have just as much right to say that YOUR horse isn''t a horse, that it is a falsity of your own make-up.''

        Ursula wavered, baffled. Then her words came.

        ''But why does he have this idea of a horse?'' she said. ''I know it is his idea. I know it is a picture of himself, really—''

        Loerke snorted with rage.

        ''A picture of myself!'' he repeated, in derision. ''Wissen sie, gnadige Frau, that is a Kunstwerk, a work of art. It is a work of art, it is a picture of nothing, of absolutely nothing. It has nothing to do with anything but itself, it has no relation with the everyday world of this and other, there is no connection between them, absolutely none, they are two different and distinct planes of existence, and to translate one into the other is worse than foolish, it is a darkening of all counsel, a making confusion everywhere. Do you see, you MUST NOT confuse the relative work of action, with the absolute world of art. That you MUST NOT DO.''

        ''That is quite true,'' cried Gudrun, let loose in a sort of rhapsody. ''The two things are quite and permanently apart, they have NOTHING to do with one another. I and my art, they have nothing to do with each other. My art stands in another world, I am in this world.''

        Her face was flushed and transfigured. Loerke who was sitting with his head ducked, like some creature at bay, looked up at her, swiftly, almost furtively, and murmured,

        ''Ja—so ist es, so ist es.''

        Ursula was silent after this outburst. She was furious. She wanted to poke a hole into them both.

        ''It isn''t a word of it true, of all this harangue you have made me,'' she replied flatly. ''The horse is a picture of your own stock, stupid brutality, and the girl was a girl you loved and tortured and then ignored.''

        He looked up at her with a small smile of contempt in his eyes. He would not trouble to answer this last charge.

        Gudrun too was silent in exasperated contempt. Ursula WAS such an insufferable outsider, rushing in where angels would fear to tread. But then—fools must be suffered, if not gladly.

        But Ursula was persistent too.

        ''As for your world of art and your world of reality,'' she replied, ''you have to separate the two, because you can''t bear to know what you are. You can''t bear to realise what a stock, stiff, hide-bound brutality you ARE really, so you say "it''s the world of art." The world of art is only the truth about the real world, that''s all—but you are too far gone to see it.''

        She was white and trembling, intent. Gudrun and Loerke sat in stiff dislike of her. Gerald too, who had come up in the beginning of the speech, stood looking at her in complete disapproval and opposition. He felt she was undignified, she put a sort of vulgarity over the esotericism which gave man his last distinction. He joined his forces with the other two. They all three wanted her to go away. But she sat on in silence, her soul weeping, throbbing violently, her fingers twisting her handkerchief.

        The others maintained a dead silence, letting the display of Ursula''s obtrusiveness pass by. Then Gudrun asked, in a voice that was quite cool and casual, as if resuming a casual conversation:

        ''Was the girl a model?''

        ''Nein, sie war kein Modell. Sie war eine kleine Malschulerin.''

        ''An art-student!'' replied Gudrun.

        And how the situation revealed itself to her! She saw the girl art-student, unformed and of pernicious recklessness, too young, her straight flaxen hair cut short, hanging just into her neck, curving inwards slightly, because it was rather thick; and Loerke, the well-known master-sculptor, and the girl, probably well-brought-up, and of good family, thinking herself so great to be his mistress. Oh how well she knew the common callousness of it all. Dresden, Paris, or London, what did it matter? She knew it.

        ''Where is she now?'' Ursula asked.

        Loerke raised his shoulders, to convey his complete ignorance and indifference.

        ''That is already six years ago,'' he said; ''she will be twenty-three years old, no more good.''

        Gerald had picked up the picture and was looking at it. It attracted him also. He saw on the pedestal, that the piece was called ''Lady Godiva.''

        ''But this isn''t Lady Godiva,'' he said, smiling good-humouredly. ''She was the middle-aged wife of some Earl or other, who covered herself with her long hair.''

        ''A la Maud Allan,'' said Gudrun with a mocking grimace.

        ''Why Maud Allan?'' he replied. ''Isn''t it so? I always thought the legend was that.''

        ''Yes, Gerald dear, I''m quite SURE you''ve got the legend perfectly.''

        She was laughing at him, with a little, mock-caressive contempt.

        ''To be sure, I''d rather see the woman than the hair,'' he laughed in return.

        ''Wouldn''t you just!'' mocked Gudrun.

        Ursula rose and went away, leaving the three together.

        Gudrun took the picture again from Gerald, and sat looking at it closely.

        ''Of course,'' she said, turning to tease Loerke now, ''you UNDERSTOOD your little Malschulerin.''

        He raised his eyebrows and his shoulders in a complacent shrug.

        ''The little girl?'' asked Gerald, pointing to the figure.

        Gudrun was sitting with the picture in her lap. She looked up at Gerald, full into his eyes, so that he seemed to be blinded.

        ''DIDN''T he understand her!'' she said to Gerald, in a slightly mocking, humorous playfulness. ''You''ve only to look at the feet—AREN''T they darling, so pretty and tender—oh, they''re really wonderful, they are really—''

        She lifted her eyes slowly, with a hot, flaming look into Loerke''s eyes. His soul was filled with her burning recognition, he seemed to grow more uppish and lordly.

        Gerald looked at the small, sculptured feet. They were turned together, half covering each other in pathetic shyness and fear. He looked at them a long time, fascinated. Then, in some pain, he put the picture away from him. He felt full of barrenness.

        ''What was her name?'' Gudrun asked Loerke.

        ''Annette von Weck,'' Loerke replied reminiscent. ''Ja, sie war hubsch. She was pretty—but she was tiresome. She was a nuisance,—not for a minute would she keep still—not until I''d slapped her hard and made her cry—then she''d sit for five minutes.''

        He was thinking over the work, his work, the all important to him.

        ''Did you really slap her?'' asked Gudrun, coolly.

        He glanced back at her, reading her challenge.

        ''Yes, I did,'' he said, nonchalant, ''harder than I have ever beat anything in my life. I had to, I had to. It was the only way I got the work done.''

        Gudrun watched him with large, dark-filled eyes, for some moments. She seemed to be considering his very soul. Then she looked down, in silence.

        ''Why did you have such a young Godiva then?'' asked Gerald. ''She is so small, besides, on the horse—not big enough for it—such a child.''

        A queer spasm went over Loerke''s face.

        ''Yes,'' he said. ''I don''t like them any bigger, any older. Then they are beautiful, at sixteen, seventeen, eighteen—after that, they are no use to me.''

        There was a moment''s pause.

        ''Why not?'' asked Gerald.

        Loerke shrugged his shoulders.

        ''I don''t find them interesting—or beautiful—they are no good to me, for my work.''

        ''Do you mean to say a woman isn''t beautiful after she is twenty?'' asked Gerald.

        ''For me, no. Before twenty, she is small and fresh and tender and slight. After that—let her be what she likes, she has nothing for me. The Venus of Milo is a bourgeoise—so are they all.''

        ''And you don''t care for women at all after twenty?'' asked Gerald.

        ''They are no good to me, they are of no use in my art,'' Loerke repeated impatiently. ''I don''t find them beautiful.''

        ''You are an epicure,'' said Gerald, with a slight sarcastic laugh.

        ''And what about men?'' asked Gudrun suddenly.

        ''Yes, they are good at all ages,'' replied Loerke. ''A man should be big and powerful—whether he is old or young is of no account, so he has the size, something of massiveness and—and stupid form.''

        Ursula went out alone into the world of pure, new snow. But the dazzling whiteness seemed to beat upon her till it hurt her, she felt the cold was slowly strangling her soul. Her head felt dazed and numb.

        Suddenly she wanted to go away. It occurred to her, like a miracle, that she might go away into another world. She had felt so doomed up here in the eternal snow, as if there were no beyond.

        Now suddenly, as by a miracle she remembered that away beyond, below her, lay the dark fruitful earth, that towards the south there were stretches of land dark with orange trees and cypress, grey with olives, that ilex trees lifted wonderful plumy tufts in shadow against a blue sky. Miracle of miracles!—this utterly silent, frozen world of the mountain-tops was not universal! One might leave it and have done with it. One might go away.

        She wanted to realise the miracle at once. She wanted at this instant to have done with the snow-world, the terrible, static ice-built mountain tops. She wanted to see the dark earth, to smell its earthy fecundity, to see the patient wintry vegetation, to feel the sunshine touch a response in the buds.

        She went back gladly to the house, full of hope. Birkin was reading, lying in bed.

        ''Rupert,'' she said, bursting in on him. ''I want to go away.''

        He looked up at her slowly.

        ''Do you?'' he replied mildly.

        She sat by him und put her arms round his neck. It surprised her that he was so little surprised.

        ''Don''t YOU?'' she asked troubled.

        ''I hadn''t thought about it,'' he said. ''But I''m sure I do.''

        She sat up, suddenly erect.

        ''I hate it,'' she said. ''I hate the snow, and the unnaturalness of it, the unnatural light it throws on everybody, the ghastly glamour, the unnatural feelings it makes everybody have.''

        He lay still and laughed, meditating.

        ''Well,'' he said, ''we can go away—we can go tomorrow. We''ll go tomorrow to Verona, and find Romeo and Juliet, and sit in the amphitheatre—shall we?''

        Suddenly she hid her face against his shoulder with perplexity and shyness. He lay so untrammelled.

        ''Yes,'' she said softly, filled with relief. She felt her soul had new wings, now he was so uncaring. ''I shall love to be Romeo and Juliet,'' she said. ''My love!''

        ''Though a fearfully cold wind blows in Verona,'' he said, ''from out of the Alps. We shall have the smell of the snow in our noses.''

        She sat up and looked at him.

        ''Are you glad to go?'' she asked, troubled.

        His eyes were inscrutable and laughing. She hid her face against his neck, clinging close to him, pleading:

        ''Don''t laugh at me—don''t laugh at me.''

        ''Why how''s that?'' he laughed, putting his arms round her.

        ''Because I don''t want to be laughed at,'' she whispered.

        He laughed more, as he kissed her delicate, finely perfumed hair.

        ''Do you love me?'' she whispered, in wild seriousness.

        ''Yes,'' he answered, laughing.

        Suddenly she lifted her mouth to be kissed. Her lips were taut and quivering and strenuous, his were soft, deep and delicate. He waited a few moments in the kiss. Then a shade of sadness went over his soul.

        ''Your mouth is so hard,'' he said, in faint reproach.

        ''And yours is so soft and nice,'' she said gladly.

        ''But why do you always grip your lips?'' he asked, regretful.

        ''Never mind,'' she said swiftly. ''It is my way.''

        She knew he loved her; she was sure of him. Yet she could not let go a certain hold over herself, she could not bear him to question her. She gave herself up in delight to being loved by him. She knew that, in spite of his joy when she abandoned herself, he was a little bit saddened too. She could give herself up to his activity. But she could not be herself, she DARED not come forth quite nakedly to his nakedness, abandoning all adjustment, lapsing in pure faith with him. She abandoned herself to HIM, or she took hold of him and gathered her joy of him. And she enjoyed him fully. But they were never QUITE together, at the same moment, one was always a little left out. Nevertheless she was glad in hope, glorious and free, full of life and liberty. And he was still and soft and patient, for the time.

        They made their preparations to leave the next day. First they went to Gudrun''s room, where she and Gerald were just dressed ready for the evening indoors.

        ''Prune,'' said Ursula, ''I think we shall go away tomorrow. I can''t stand the snow any more. It hurts my skin and my soul.''

        ''Does it really hurt your soul, Ursula?'' asked Gudrun, in some surprise. ''I can believe quite it hurts your skin—it is TERRIBLE. But I thought it was ADMIRABLE for the soul.''

        ''No, not for mine. It just injures it,'' said Ursula.

        ''Really!'' cried Gudrun.

        There was a silence in the room. And Ursula and Birkin could feel that Gudrun and Gerald were relieved by their going.

        ''You will go south?'' said Gerald, a little ring of uneasiness in his voice.

        ''Yes,'' said Birkin, turning away. There was a queer, indefinable hostility between the two men, lately. Birkin was on the whole dim and indifferent, drifting along in a dim, easy flow, unnoticing and patient, since he came abroad, whilst Gerald on the other hand, was intense and gripped into white light, agonistes. The two men revoked one another.

        Gerald and Gudrun were very kind to the two who were departing, solicitous for their welfare as if they were two children. Gudrun came to Ursula''s bedroom with three pairs of the coloured stockings for which she was notorious, and she threw them on the bed. But these were thick silk stockings, vermilion, cornflower blue, and grey, bought in Paris. The grey ones were knitted, seamless and heavy. Ursula was in raptures. She knew Gudrun must be feeling VERY loving, to give away such treasures.

        ''I can''t take them from you, Prune,'' she cried. ''I can''t possibly deprive you of them—the jewels.''

        ''AREN''T they jewels!'' cried Gudrun, eyeing her gifts with an envious eye. ''AREN''T they real lambs!''

        ''Yes, you MUST keep them,'' said Ursula.

        ''I don''t WANT them, I''ve got three more pairs. I WANT you to keep them—I want you to have them. They''re yours, there—''

        And with trembling, excited hands she put the coveted stockings under Ursula''s pillow.

        ''One gets the greatest joy of all out of really lovely stockings,'' said Ursula.

        ''One does,'' replied Gudrun; ''the greatest joy of all.''

        And she sat down in the chair. It was evident she had come for a last talk. Ursula, not knowing what she wanted, waited in silence.

        ''Do you FEEL, Ursula,'' Gudrun began, rather sceptically, that you are going-away-for-ever, never-to-return, sort of thing?''

        ''Oh, we shall come back,'' said Ursula. ''It isn''t a question of train-journeys.''

        ''Yes, I know. But spiritually, so to speak, you are going away from us all?''

        Ursula quivered.

        ''I don''t know a bit what is going to happen,'' she said. ''I only know we are going somewhere.''

        Gudrun waited.

        ''And you are glad?'' she asked.

        Ursula meditated for a moment.

        ''I believe I am VERY glad,'' she replied.

        But Gudrun read the unconscious brightness on her sister''s face, rather than the uncertain tones of her speech.

        ''But don''t you think you''ll WANT the old connection with the world—father and the rest of us, and all that it means, England and the world of thought—don''t you think you''ll NEED that, really to make a world?''

        Ursula was silent, trying to imagine.

        ''I think,'' she said at length, involuntarily, ''that Rupert is right—one wants a new space to be in, and one falls away from the old.''

        Gudrun watched her sister with impassive face and steady eyes.

        ''One wants a new space to be in, I quite agree,'' she said. ''But I think that a new world is a development from this world, and that to isolate oneself with one other person, isn''t to find a new world at all, but only to secure oneself in one''s illusions.''

        Ursula looked out of the window. In her soul she began to wrestle, and she was frightened. She was always frightened of words, because she knew that mere word-force could always make her believe what she did not believe.

        ''Perhaps,'' she said, full of mistrust, of herself and everybody. ''But,'' she added, ''I do think that one can''t have anything new whilst one cares for the old—do you know what I mean?—even fighting the old is belonging to it. I know, one is tempted to stop with the world, just to fight it. But then it isn''t worth it.''

        Gudrun considered herself.

        ''Yes,'' she said. ''In a way, one is of the world if one lives in it. But isn''t it really an illusion to think you can get out of it? After all, a cottage in the Abruzzi, or wherever it may be, isn''t a new world. No, the only thing to do with the world, is to see it through.''

        Ursula looked away. She was so frightened of argument.

        ''But there CAN be something else, can''t there?'' she said. ''One can see it through in one''s soul, long enough before it sees itself through in actuality. And then, when one has seen one''s soul, one is something else.''

        ''CAN one see it through in one''s soul?'' asked Gudrun. ''If you mean that you can see to the end of what will happen, I don''t agree. I really can''t agree. And anyhow, you can''t suddenly fly off on to a new planet, because you think you can see to the end of this.''

        Ursula suddenly straightened herself.

        ''Yes,'' she said. ''Yes—one knows. One has no more connections here. One has a sort of other self, that belongs to a new planet, not to this. You''ve got to hop off.''

        Gudrun reflected for a few moments. Then a smile of ridicule, almost of contempt, came over her face.

        ''And what will happen when you find yourself in space?'' she cried in derision. ''After all, the great ideas of the world are the same there. You above everybody can''t get away from the fact that love, for instance, is the supreme thing, in space as well as on earth.''

        ''No,'' said Ursula, ''it isn''t. Love is too human and little. I believe in something inhuman, of which love is only a little part. I believe what we must fulfil comes out of the unknown to us, and it is something infinitely more than love. It isn''t so merely HUMAN.''

        Gudrun looked at Ursula with steady, balancing eyes. She admired and despised her sister so much, both! Then, suddenly she averted her face, saying coldly, uglily:

        ''Well, I''ve got no further than love, yet.''

        Over Ursula''s mind flashed the thought: ''Because you never HAVE loved, you can''t get beyond it.''

        Gudrun rose, came over to Ursula and put her arm round her neck.

        ''Go and find your new world, dear,'' she said, her voice clanging with false benignity. ''After all, the happiest voyage is the quest of Rupert''s Blessed Isles.''

        Her arm rested round Ursula''s neck, her fingers on Ursula''s cheek for a few moments. Ursula was supremely uncomfortable meanwhile. There was an insult in Gudrun''s protective patronage that was really too hurting. Feeling her sister''s resistance, Gudrun drew awkwardly away, turned over the pillow, and disclosed the stockings again.

        ''Ha—ha!'' she laughed, rather hollowly. ''How we do talk indeed—new worlds and old—!''

        And they passed to the familiar worldly subjects.

        Gerald and Birkin had walked on ahead, waiting for the sledge to overtake them, conveying the departing guests.

        ''How much longer will you stay here?'' asked Birkin, glancing up at Gerald''s very red, almost blank face.

        ''Oh, I can''t say,'' Gerald replied. ''Till we get tired of it.''

        ''You''re not afraid of the snow melting first?'' asked Birkin.

        Gerald laughed.

        ''Does it melt?'' he said.

        ''Things are all right with you then?'' said Birkin.

        Gerald screwed up his eyes a little.

        ''All right?'' he said. ''I never know what those common words mean. All right and all wrong, don''t they become synonymous, somewhere?''

        ''Yes, I suppose. How about going back?'' asked Birkin.

        ''Oh, I don''t know. We may never get back. I don''t look before and after,'' said Gerald.

        ''NOR pine for what is not,'' said Birkin.

        Gerald looked into the distance, with the small-pupilled, abstract eyes of a hawk.

        ''No. There''s something final about this. And Gudrun seems like the end, to me. I don''t know—but she seems so soft, her skin like silk, her arms heavy and soft. And it withers my consciousness, somehow, it burns the pith of my mind.'' He went on a few paces, staring ahead, his eyes fixed, looking like a mask used in ghastly religions of the barbarians. ''It blasts your soul''s eye,'' he said, ''and leaves you sightless. Yet you WANT to be sightless, you WANT to be blasted, you don''t want it any different.''

        He was speaking as if in a trance, verbal and blank. Then suddenly he braced himself up with a kind of rhapsody, and looked at Birkin with vindictive, cowed eyes, saying:

        ''Do you know what it is to suffer when you are with a woman? She''s so beautiful, so perfect, you find her SO GOOD, it tears you like a silk, and every stroke and bit cuts hot—ha, that perfection, when you blast yourself, you blast yourself! And then—'' he stopped on the snow and suddenly opened his clenched hands—''it''s nothing—your brain might have gone charred as rags—and—'' he looked round into the air with a queer histrionic movement ''it''s blasting—you understand what I mean—it is a great experience, something final—and then—you''re shrivelled as if struck by electricity.'' He walked on in silence. It seemed like bragging, but like a man in extremity bragging truthfully.

        ''Of course,'' he resumed, ''I wouldn''t NOT have had it! It''s a complete experience. And she''s a wonderful woman. But—how I hate her somewhere! It''s curious—''

        Birkin looked at him, at his strange, scarcely conscious face. Gerald seemed blank before his own words.

        ''But you''ve had enough now?'' said Birkin. ''You have had your experience. Why work on an old wound?''

        ''Oh,'' said Gerald, ''I don''t know. It''s not finished—''

        And the two walked on.

        ''I''ve loved you, as well as Gudrun, don''t forget,'' said Birkin bitterly. Gerald looked at him strangely, abstractedly.

        ''Have you?'' he said, with icy scepticism. ''Or do you think you have?'' He was hardly responsible for what he said.

        The sledge came. Gudrun dismounted and they all made their farewell. They wanted to go apart, all of them. Birkin took his place, and the sledge drove away leaving Gudrun and Gerald standing on the snow, waving. Something froze Birkin''s heart, seeing them standing there in the isolation of the snow, growing smaller and more isolated.

– Thoughts on this event? Your opinion on the battle of different battle leagues? Predictions on the result?
– My only prediction is 4:0, like in the match between SKA-Energia and Spartak that''s gonna happen soon, it''s gonna be kinda same. Damn, it''s SKA-Khabarovsk now, sorry
– Aight, guess you gotta chill a bit. Good luck on the battle!
– Antihype!

– Salute! Introduce yourself
– My name is Miron
– Who''s your opponent?
– My opponent is my old @%#$rider
– Why did you decide to accept to battle with him?
– Well, I didn''t accept it, I invited him. He''s a true battle MC, I never battled against those. They''re people who can''t really write songs, they''re always battling, so they become sort of local gods, so I''m interested, just for the sport of it, to see how I''ll perform against him
– You''re a successful man, why do you need battles?
– I''m doing it just for the sport of it, as I said. I started with battles, I''m not stopping any time soon. Just to prove to myself, another check mark, another check mark. Or no check mark, I''m ready for whatever
– How does it feel to battle on behalf of Versus? Today is the battle between two battle leagues and we  came here to @%#! those guys from Slovo up
– Yep
– How do you feel?
– I''m ready for this
– Well, good luck then

[Round 1: Oxxxymiron]
I''m here just for fun, really, just to mock a weak one
You crawled out of your mother while my Baban diss was playing in background
Accusatory pathos is zilch against the father
Those rhymes were written by drunk and high Kripl
You''re funny, way too tall, and you''re honestly clumsy
Your body reminds me of a pregnant heron
Unproportional, like your hype and your contribution into rap
Not A Cloud in Trousers, you''re just a trend, like cloud rap
Here only for couple seasons. Where''s your choker? Why?
You don''t wanna go out of vogue, like Volchok clothes
The person who pushed you forward a year ago with just one tweet
Now will flush you away in the toilet
What an Irony of Fate, fascinating, isn''t it?
Before battling someone, I have to praise him
To prove all of you that he can be the victor
Before crushing an MC, you have to love him in the beginning
I did great
I knew that Gotham needed a Joker
Who''s against me. Full moon rising
The town cheers for him, a new character in the deck
But I''m the director myself, I created you, I filmed you
I''m Bruce Wayne and Christopher Nolan together
All roles are prepared already, yours is written from the beginning to the end
I needed an enemy? Voila!
You''re a theatrical villain, your mustache fell off
Yeah, you''re a Joker, but up my sleeve. Shave your ace
And get ready, Arkham gives you a free lodging
And my @%#$ knows what''s up with all these cuts you have
[Slava KPSS interrupts him]
I agree

I''m the master of promotion
You found the casting and started pulling off your underwear:
– Are you really the producer?
– Yes, I really am
I''ll make you, son. You''re my !#!$ slave
Call me Fadeev Maxim
That''s a fat promotion
I''m taking you off a cage by pulling the strings
How does it feel when you know that you''re a marionette in the Jew''s hands?
You hyped for a year using my name
Okay, I don''t mind the hype
It''s just sad that you''re a miserable lackey
Couldn''t go up yourself, still a nobody at the bottom
Your "fans" are angry that I don''t release a new mixtape
Your eyes tell me that you wrote text for this battle back in December
Because the school of Slovo...

[Restorator screams]
IS THE WEAKEST LEAGUE IN THE COUNTRY

Yeah, we''re about SlovoSPB. You got owned by RBL
I''d get bodied by Zabe, Teeraps, and Piem, if they tried
But the rest, all of you are mediocrities
30 weeks for the text, and then fake, pretend you just started writing
Been writing it in December, January, February, March, April
May, June, July. And thought, the text is ok, Tech N9ne, boo!
I wrote mine in a week, plus-minus two days
I''m afraid of you 30 times less than you''re afraid of me
But don''t be afraid. What do you have at stake, Olimpiyskiy?
Dozens of paid Petersburg people, who all depend on the battle
Who''ll lose everything in case of a loss?
But an MC should be ashamed if he''s been preparing for months
Memorized your lines? Good job!
[Slava KPSS replies]
Nope

The person frazzled by Ramzan

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Bodybag!

[Oxxxymiron repeats]
Bodybag!

When I invited him to battle, he was all about those ideals
But in a year you lost your way, Slava
What can a person, who repeated every mistake after me, in just one year, really tell me?
I''m nine years in this game, you''re just helping me, slug
You, like myself, have changed? But the sales are still the same
You, like myself, have apologized? But no one even hit you!

Real talk, real talk

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Isn''t it @%#!ing wonderful, guys?

You, like myself, became a businessman, but still sound like a commissioner
You, like myself, were against that rap herd, but still recording with all of them
We''re all hypocrites, because we change every day
What once was true, may change one day, perhaps even completely
But your worldview changed in a record time!
Bam! And you''re on the stage
Bam! And you''re recording with LSP
Bam! And you''re releasing cheap clothes at Vitya SD''s
The Flow is writing reviews, all good and real
But in a year underground cat became exactly what he had rebuked
And your idea, bled like Lyalya
You''re throwing stones while sitting in a glass house
Was in the basement, but the attic got flooded
Searching for walls by running From Castle to Castle
But you build them on sand
And your showy kindergarten in your secondhand lyrics
Is obvious to everyone, believe me, it was boring to write a text against you
Even Johnyboy was more of a true guy, in comparison with you
Together, you should open a hookah-barber-sushi-smoothie-vape bar
Antihype? That''s Vagabund, that''s Vagabund
For people in backwoods who use Windows 3 with a dial up modem, while not knowing how to enable cookies
"We need more members", Booker taught you this way
You need to open an escort agency "Booking muzhchin"
And it''s all giggles, but the truth hurts
He''ll talk a lot, but he can''t say much
You can dig up all the dirt and my dead friends
Can wash all my bones, along with dirty linen, cook your black kisel
Can find out with whom, how many times, and in what poses I had %!@
But if you do this, you''re done, too
Look, he has a girlfriend called Sasha Discotheque

[Slava KPSS interrupts him]
Not anymore, man, you''re too late

[Oxxymiron replies]
It doesn''t matter

Imagine how many punchlines about her I could come up with!
Or about ST''s wife, it''s so cute
But I came here to battle you, not her
Not your parents, not your mother''s bank account
Not your promiscuous %!@ual behavior, Fallen doesn''t count (here he is!) Fallen doesn''t count

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Fallen! Fallen MC!

And he, who uses rumors about relatives, just shows who''s the father on this arena
Think about it, lad, all you''ll see is you getting promoted in MDK
How many millions I made last year – that''s what Forbes and RBK are arguing about
Obviously, there''s a bunch of rumors about me
I even stopped bringing groupies, what if they make a hole in a condom?
And then they will leak our photos to OK magazine, that''s the dark side of being famous...
...just like his trip to Phuket half a year ago
Whoops!

[Slava KPSS puzzled]
What? Are you high? Are you high?

[Voice in background]
True story!

I have little birds too, and unlike yours they''ve got clip microphones on them
He thinks, "I hope he didn''t find out about Golden Resort!"
Bro, there''s no shame in it, there''s no shame in it!
Let''s put it this way. For a short time, and it was rather innocent
But he had a friend known as "the dancer"
Not really a masseur, not really a make-up artist, not really an exotic dancer
But that''s not the problem, the problem was that he basically looked like a typical trans
Give me this folder!
Here. Now, I''d like anyone, who actually saw Karelin on Resort, to come here
Oh well, looks like there are none today, but a little bit more and y''all would believe me!
Battles with real facts! Battles with real facts!

[Voices in background]
Genius! Bravo! We need to think about this one

Battles with real facts – the gift for liars
The truth? Nah, just know how to present it properly

[Slava KPSS replies]
Yep

If you''re gonna dig up all the dirt, searching in the garbage
You will represent not Slovo, but Podslushano Khabarovsk

[Slava KPSS cheers]
Yeeeaa. Nice!

So, basically, you have two lines of attack:
Either blame me for something you''re even worse at, well, that''s dumb
Or, like Cynics, be a dog, and come up with something rotten about me, $#%! yourself right here
Gnojnyj, your words are pure air
You look like E.T., but landed in Grozny, as it seems
It''s easy to get in here swiftly, but as easy to get shredded
You had a decent year, it''s not too late to leave
Time!

[Voices in background]
Slava, @%#! him up! Slava, @%#! him up!

[Round 1: Slava KPSS]
Slava KPSS and Oxxxy, the new punk wave
And everyone was waiting for a performance of the King and the Jester
Well, @%#! this!
I declare, you''re dead as a creator and you don''t deserve to be honored as a cult rap singer
I don''t accept your accomplishments, so when I spit my rhymes I remind you of your father
Let''s talk about your album, !#!$yze it in Lavrentiy Beria''s cold-blooded manner
You performed poorly in your Gryffindor, if there''s something Russians are good at, then it''s destroying the empires
Everyone waited four years for it, he tried his best to intrigue them
And what he came up with? Recorded an audiobook
A trivial dystopia, by the way
That''s the level of discourse of Jahmal and Loik
With a plot that any stupid %$#@@ could come up with
Your rap is cheap literature in paperback
It''s just a bunch of the most boring cliches in history
Original plot: tragic love story in a dystopia
No one @%#!ing came up with something like this before, right?
Neither Orwell nor Zamyatin
It''s a pop motif everyone @%#!ing fed up with already
But you said it yourself to Afisha, "It''s not about how good an idea is, it''s only about its survivability"
Well, if your music is a brand, then why don''t I choose Gucci?
It''s commercial too, just like your allegedly breakthrough album with the smart punchlines with a dash at the end
A used condom can make some noise too, if it ends up in a female monastery
I remember that @%#!ing feeling when your fans started playing your album loudly in my house
It felt like I''m a honey dipper who got his annual salary paid in $#%!
Well, look at this little @%#! who emerged as a king
Loved to drop names so much that he even came up with his own ones
So conceptual because you got tired of the craft
You ran out of ideas even before you started writing
Used to be "against everybody", now he''s kinda our guy
The album is so crap that it got praised by Noize, you get it?

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Right in the heart! Right in the heart!

You said he was a graphomaniac to the core
And he praises Gorgorod, and not, let''s say, your first mixtape
It''s not a coincidence, Ogorod is a piece of grinded out $#%!
I don''t see 11 tracks, I see 11 sentences for raping myself
You come up with new characters like a @%#!ing cripple sculpts in clay with his stump hands
It''s hard to mix up you and a poet, like a bag of @%#$s and a spinner
"A slim print of a shoulder", teachers, what a shame!
You couldn''t see this in Pasternak''s work, it''s simply illiteracy!
A print of a slim shoulder! @%#!, writing isn''t your strongest suit
You come up with not punchlines, but silliness like "handball world record"
The @%#! is this? It''s on your album
The @%#! is this, idiot? Where''s the work on the word?
Where are the unexpected meanings, man?
It sounds like a misstep in porno:
You thought if people lick your ass, you can $#%! on the tongue
And when you get a diarrhea, you know what will be the ugliest?
That all your trips into the toilet are connected with each other, even your $#%! is conceptual!
@%#! all the dumb politicians and all those greedy bankers
The worst are you, the creators of this indecent subjectivity
Where "third-tier remix of Yesenin" or top-tier one of Aldous Huxley
Have the social approval. But I don''t @%#!ing care about Jewish fairy tales
I don''t listen to Gorgorod, don''t read Torah, and don''t hang around Echo of Moscow
Weird, they love the bald ones in the Right Sector, but they would still @%#! you up

[Shouts to the crowd]
Hush! Hush!

For Brodsky-like graphomania, Yesenin-like $#%!-tier lyricism
Where are you walking the edge yourself? At the edge of a pool near a hotel?
@%#!, when you tell me that I''m not really a musician
And only live on some dubious hype
You''ll basically describe yourself
After all, Gorgorod is not even a good calque, not a napalm, but a bubble gum
You just $#%! a bunch of liberal cliches
But writing dystopias, what kind of a protest is that, dumbo?
Useless like police shooting a gay parade with rubber bullets
You didn''t spit from the barricades
And even your favorite Lamar said "@%#! Trump!"
But for you "@%#! up" is an open visors evening
Where you''re afraid to talk freely. And even He Is Not Dimon to You
Is braver in this aspect than your @%#!ing album
You''re like, "I''m not a politician, I''m an artist, I don''t write statements, I write tracks"

[Voice in background]
True story!

But like a politician you''re a populist, otherwise why would you get into all this?
You were rooting so @%#!ing much for Russia that you started nervously losing ganglia?
But when we had protests here, where you were? In England!
London, London, teach us how to live! How are we Rebuilding Russia without you?
You impose your dime novel as political satire
But don''t call them by names, it''s full of Jewish surnames
And we have a tradition in Russia, we don''t call the names when we talk about a rat in our own collective
Meanwhile I bring you the revolution, like back in the days, straight from Tushino
The wheels of this cart are spinning. The Futurists threw Pushkin from the steamship of modernity!
And you kept Oxxxy. Because he''s alive!
But he''s just a living proof of how anyone can run out of ink and become a nobody in four years
Spent your talent, not on the hop, but on dope and dust
Your Oxxxy is just an inflated figure, like a glass rooster
Time!


[Round 2: Oxxxymiron]
Yo. He said he didn''t listen to Gorgorod, but the spring will tell us who $#%! where
The whole your first round is a paraphrase of the track "Who You Became". Think about it

[Slava KPSS and Oxxxy]
– Nope. Nope, it''s not
– Yes, it is. Relisten it again, bro
– Nope. I did listen to it

Anyway. Yo. Give me mic, start the cypher, let''s hype
Let''s offend mother and lie, steal and bite
Pour a tub of $#%! over the brothers, ghostwriter is found
Rhythm? @%#! it! On the battle, become more popular than aristocracy
So, stop it. Don''t compare us
Back in the day I was anti-, was breaking their moral grounds
So I could $#%! on an average man – pioneer
I should have kept you as sperm on the bed
Since what was fresh back then, back in the years
Completely different now, unfortunately, unfunny stand-up
One thing is violating a tabu, turn the crowd inside out
Twist the listener with the power of words, eat their soul
And another thing is a conveyor of $#%!
No goals, only one idea: to get the most likes. Isn''t it true
That like Ernesto you wanted to get on TV?
It''s okay, I don''t judge. Even though your duplicity is kinda awful
Actually, whatever, he''s a swindler
Personally, I never performed on a corporate party
It''s hard to hear for me when people are chewing
Never was on radio, was on TV only once
Even though I get a lot of requests daily, like it''s PMs from lolis
Meanwhile, if you were me, you''d be singing in Golden Ogonyok right now
Saying "I''m here just to troll"
True, true story

[Slava KPSS replies]
Yes

To give you an idea, I didn''t record with Major Lazer for 15 millions
You''d suck a black #@$% for pocket change from a sponsor, like the writer Limonov

[Slava KPSS pointing at Oxxxy]
Smart guy

And they say, "Mirosha, you crazy!"
Nope, I just don''t like Major Lazer
They say, "you''re a dumbass"
But true fans know, I appreciate them, Oxxxytentacion
I have three X''s too, ayy
You''ll disappear, like my mixtape
A lot of doubts, Miron, ayy
Who likes %!#%@es in his mouth? Gay
You''ve got a new release? Ayy
You''ve got a hundredth release? Ayy
If your rap is rap, then my rap if you''re with me shout "ayy!"
Look, only SlovoSPB remained silent. WindbagsSPB
I will never visit you, like it''s a school of MVD
Underdogs of battle rap? Nah, you''re snobs without cash
Topical battle with Shurygina? It''s the bottom of SPB

[Slava KPSS asking]
What does it have to do with me?

Nah, I''m not even arguing, Versus is bull$#%! too
With such an energetic start, it became a nightmare in half a year

[Oxxxymiron to Restorator]
You thought I''d give you a line and will remain silent?
Yeah, we''re friends, but you $#%! on what we started together

[Slava KPSS talking to his friends in background]
Easy. Like I said, he talks about this $#%!

And that''s not a stab in the back, Sanya, remember with Jan
How many times did I explain it to you?
Versus used to be a place where we''d find the new talents
Now it''s a place where every mediocrity can get some quick dough
Where you can fall flat on your face, like Larin
A flock of blogger-fans will like these 5 minutes of fame anyway
Offbeat? Screw it! Reloads, reposts, BMW, BPM
Less rappers than sponsors. Circus!
What about rap-hagakure, the way of bushido?
I keep mumbling about the culture, like Redo bit me
"The old man is just envious of Khovan''s and Eldar''s success!", nah
It''s just that all your idols have the same ghostwriter from Fresh Blood
And it''s not a protest, I''m not hip-hop policeman
And when he doesn''t offend the dead, Khovan is a pretty good guy
But since all of your bloggers and comics are passing through battle rap
Let''s be honest and list all the writers

Easy, easy, real talk, real talk

But I believe, Versus will resurrect
And if it''s not Slovo, then it''s a bluff
Me and Sanya have a bunch of @%#! ups
But wounded lion is still a lion
While a healthy jackal remains a jackal
You thought I''m afraid of somebody?
Your jokes, punchlines, Zamay and Berserk?
Bro, I''ve seen much worse, I swear!
Console yourself that you''re still underground
And you''re still on top
But I''m like NTV, who wants all the ins and outs of SlovoSPB?
Well, listen what happened five years ago
There was no Versus, no Slovo, rap was shouting "dat''s what''s up!"
Andrey Mikheyev knew, that I''m following King of the Dot since 2008, and told that to Hyde
Krasnodar is on the line, we spoke through Skype for 3 hours
Hints, questions, how to write texts for battles
I remember how I explained them that I''m tired of freestyles
All the schemes, flips, who to stand correctly
And we both were sick with this $#%!
Well, that''s basically the whole story, how this project was born
I was there in the beginning, kiss the ring! Dat''s what''s up!
Since I was the consigliere of Don Anton, your godfather
Everyone who says "what?" doesn''t know the history
Anyway
So, don''t want to kiss the ring?
How predictable, he''s not an authority to you
You wanna organize your own battle-quartet

[Talks to Den Cheney]
But Cheney, stop this bull$#%!, you knew
I kept the neutrality, but you keep misleading everyone
You and Berserk didn''t just leave Hyde
Betraying father and the project
You secretly registered your rights for the project!
And I heard this story

Real talk, real talk in this bitch

First you secretly registered your right for the project
And I heard this story from you and PLC
You came up with a bunch of excuses, but I asked you straight:
If Hyde and PLC are really exploiting the weak, fascists
And you''re innocent victims, slaves of the franchise
Then why didn''t you create a new battle with a new name, but stole their name and registered it like rats?
And you know what he told me? True story:
"Eastern Roman Empire", remember?
We were sitting in front of 1703, Koryushka party, remember, remember!
"Eastern Roman Empire didn''t change their name when they separated from Roman"
Well, Deniska, you''re a bad boy, a radish
When I was partying with him, I kept my wallet really close
And thanks for the history class you read me generously
Unfortunately, pathos and demagoguery won''t help you, Denis
You abandoned the ship and stole a loose lifeboat in a hurry
Brought a crew of midgets, kept telling us bull$#%! for years
And you didn''t visit us to be friends, you hated us
Your tamed %!@#$ Stefan and a pocket Jew Edik
You''re forever in the shadow of your Big Brother
You''re a calque, even while drunk
You''re Restorator on minimal settings
You''re not Slovo, you''re not Versus, you''re a fake branch
Impostors, the whole logo is full of someone else''s achievements
Die, SlovoSPB!
You built a crypt, thought you could hide it from them
Your story, but sorry, bro, I''m gonna open up this abscess
There''s an alchemy formula, what''s on top is on the bottom too
If rats are controlling Slovo, what do you expect from the servants?
And in you, like in a microcosm, Slovo truly reflects
All your envious intrusiveness, along with your stung pride
What''s there left for Gnojnyj?
Keep trolling and be always against something
Except you, sir, when trolling, you don''t fight, you echo me

[Talks to Zamay]
If it''s cool, Zamay, alright, continue
Continue offending me in vain, bro

Bull$#%!ting about hype with Antihype you can''t hide the lack of meaning behind the predicate
And I dunno why Jubilee found the feigned couldn''t-care-less attitude
Dunno why Ernesto battled you like a you''re an angry communist
You''re simply empty, absolutely empty, nothing behind your soul, I''m sorry for it
You were spitting rhymes about monkeys, but you''re a primate too
But you''re a primacy of the form over the content
Diss after diss, after release, after mixtape, after remix. Your incontinence is so huge
That you''ve got diarrhea without $#%!, it''s simply water. Instead of your ass you use your two hemispheres
You''re not a byaka, you''re way too fragile
Achilles, turtle, heel
Soaking up, like a sponge
But I''m gonna squeeze you, like a rag
You''re cheap copy of Versus
You are a funny cosplay of me
Waiting for the new intro, where Cheney riding a Lexus around 1702 bar
It''s hard to forget me, impossible to hurt my feelings, all your tries are off the mark
Miss Russia, Oksana Fyodorova, Sonya is here as an ugly friend
I''m not a partymaker, I''m a bodybagger
Antifaker, original Russian hater
My mother is Jewish, my father is like Drake''s father
Bitch, I''m Ice Kid like Grime Kid and @%#!in'' bagging
Canning, mother@%#!ing, Town, E16, baby!
Slava, it''s time to go to bed, collect the stickers
But no matter what you won''t understand how to write cool tracks
Since the only thing you''re good at is battling and creating remakes
And me? I''m the Universal Soldier, the clubs won''t be sold out
While you *spits* keep removing my saliva from your forehead
You dolt, we''re family here, Obi and Drago are both friends
We''re like The Three Musketeers from Remarque''s and Dumas'' novel
How do you say it? *pow pow* In your face with RPG
Your praised legion? Plasterboard and particle board
Y''all are just loudmouths with teen overblown ego
Versus is something SlovoSPB can never be!
That''s it, that''s the whole story with chronicle
And my dead homie aka Nikolay Gumilyov will help me with the epilogue
That''s about you:

In olden days, when above the new world
God inclined his face, then
The sun was halted with a word
A word could destroy cities

And the eagle would not flap its wings
The terrified stars would cling to the moon
When, like a pink flame
The word floated in the heavens

But you have forgotten the word alone
Is numinous among earthly struggles
And in the Gospel According to John
It is said that the word is God

You have chosen to limit it
To the boring limits of nature
And, like bees in a deserted hive
Dead words smell bad

Versus!

[Oxxxymiron talks while brooming]
– I don''t mind
– Could clean the sneakers too, while you''re at it
– Nah, bro

[Round 2: Slava KPSS]
So well-mannered, huh?

Thought you invited me to battle. That''s a brave deed as for a Jew
And then I realized, that''s not bravery, it''s just a common sense:
If you''re fighting, you die faster
You reanimated my career, hyped it up to eleven!
One day I''m gonna write a book called "The tweet that changed my life"
But my grandpa is Johnyboy and he taught me, "don''t believe the Jew
Cuz if he''s throwing you a ring buoy then your career is sinking"
So no remorse! KPSS is in this skirmish
The only sober like it''s a drunk fight
Remember the communist from the forum tore you a new one?
I''m not Baban''s biter, I''m mimicking the maniac
Are you really an opponent for me, though, with punchlines about "this big"?
Imma @%#! you up with whatever I have lying around
Here''s a shelf full of your @%#! ups, I''m picking a random one
You considered Guf to be $#%!, now you kinda admire him
"The burry talent", huh?
You''d be like "@%#! it" towards the Russian rap, but it''s a hard thing to do when you''re castrated
Either you''re a trimmer or it took you years to see Guf''s talent, go figure
You represent this cheap $#%! called the Plastic World
And if the judges look at him lovingly then consider him a winner already
Knowing where the noise is coming from is your superhero ability
Oxxxy vane, he changes his direction even when someone is blowing a tailwind
Yeah, this soldier doesn''t hold a defense
@%#!, even a pathologist gets under the skin more frequently than him
Can''t say a bad word about anyone nowadays
According to the contract, you remain toothless, like Alexander Ovechkin
We''re on the war here, yeah
And you ran away, leaving behind the outpost
You just stand aside and watch
Like those Germans who allowed the Holocaust
You say you changed the direction?
Nah, you only changed where you''re rowing towards
Stopped @%#!ing others'' mothers, he''s an adult now, what''s next?
A battle every year, so what, where are the punchlines?
Your bars in battles are an ugly bride
Wanna marry her off, but she got nothing to ask the price for
And how a person can stand behind something if there''s nothing to stand behind?
It''s painful to watch your attempts
You get the battle contexts just as good as the dude in "Dad reacts to Versus" videos
Check it @%#!ing yourself, fantastic Miron''s punchlines without himself lose their shine
"You''re not the creator of golems, but on this photo you''re like a potter"!

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Top punchline!

And that''s not the only one. The one about @%#!ing "awl in the ass", "the bad energetics" one, "Gulkin''s @%#$" one
If someone else used those, they''d send him to RBL

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
– RBL respect!
– @%#! them

But not you, nah, since you came up with this obscene counting-out rhyme
What''s next? On this battle you gonna fart in front of a lighter?
Or the one about pithecanthropus, bro
That punchline was really @%#!ing dumb
I''m not Oxxxymiron, but
You guys perform like a lubricant on a @%#$head
Exactly the same, absolutely no additional information
On his next album he''s gonna rhyme, "We give you everything, like a passport in UVD!"
Or about @%#!ing #%@!$#%! geolocation
#%@!$#%! geolocation, wonderful!
So you don''t believe in ZOG, but believe that a #%@!$#%! sends some information to a satellite?

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
It was a joke, idiot

And his texts are full of $#%! like this
Works perfectly ofc, since he serves it with an arrogant face of an expert
"My flow is a DDoS attack, we''ve got the remote access"!

[Oxxxymiron replies]
So-so punchline, yeah

Remote access, eh?
You $#%!ty scholar, we won''t get far in space with specialists like this
DDoS actually prevents the remote access!

[Oxxxymiron talks to his friend in the crowd]
Jan, I checked this punchline with you, why didn''t you tell me?

Or maybe "you''re speaking too fast, and I''m listening too slow"?
They even made merch based on this phrase, for the smartest ones
But what you might not know is that this phrase was first used in 2010 by Nonna Grishayeva in the TV show Big Difference

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Dunno who that is, sorry bro

Yeah? So either you stole it knowingly
Or your level, scum, is comedy cud from TV
So those who get it and who can''t stand the TV
Won''t notice the difference if "City under the sole" is playing there the whole day
But Miron doesn''t need punchlines, he''s an interesting dude either way
Today you''re watching battles without punchlines, and tomorrow it''s gonna be porn without girls

[Oxxxymiron talks to his friends behind]
My texts don''t have any punchlines? I don''t get it

Personalities, personalities, personalities!
What are those @%#!ing personalities?
They believe that I was drinking $@#% from a boot, and that you dated Sonya Grese

[Oxxxymiron shouts]
Never!

And that your mouth has so much protein in it that you can bake the full tray of meringue
Since battles are the after-truth territory
It doesn''t matter which fact is truthful
So what''s up with the personalities, @%#!ing retard, it''s all about the number of punchlines
I''ve got a full pack of equivalent bars, like it''s Fix Price
If the king dies, the coffin should be king-size
Oh, you need a cupboard to keep the skeletons of those you''ve battled with?
I''ve got an interesting fact for you: I need 4 of those, since I''ve battled 16 times
And they put you against the wall with John
I guess out of this firing squad I''m the only one who has live ammunition?
They buried themselves, but you pretended like you''re helping them:
You motivated ST, threw a ring buoy to John, was lecturing Kripl

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
You''re next, you''re next, you''re next. Let''s do this, let''s do this, let''s do this

[Slava KPSS shouts at the audience]
Silence! Shut the @%#! up, bitches!

Listen here, you @%#!ing piece of crap, you can seduce others with your sonnets
I''m not Finland for you, so don''t you, bitch, come to me with your pieces of advice
And stop talking about yourself. @%#!, I call you Dryomin
A battler is supposed to be a psychologist, and not act like he''s visiting one

[Oxxxymiron addresses the viewer]
Hah! Remember this

If you forget about the opponent while battling him
Then you''re probably jerking off near the toilet when you visit your girlfriend
And the she says, "Miron, let''s move to my place?"
And you reply, "I don''t wanna @%#! with you, I''m here to improve my results from the previous %!@!"
The father of battle rap in Russian, you produce some dubious stuff
Antihype is a social service, I take the parental rights away from you
You act like you''re fighting for improvement, but it''s all empty talk
You have never visited another battle league
How would you know if the culture is still alive if you don''t measure the pulse?
Make battle rap great again? You don''t even know that it''s dying, no new talented MCs
Raytraun is battling at Versus now. We''re doing the remakes of the old finals
In fact, we''re kicking around the dead genre
Battle rap is dead, there''s no underground
Meanwhile, mainstream is a shame, like Fresh Blood on blood
But if it''s gonna die while being filmed
I wanna be the gun shooting at Brandon Lee!

Oh, and I wanna pronounce the time of death: 17:03!
Time!

[Round 3: Oxxxymiron]
Have you noticed this? Third rounds always hit the hardest
MCs always put some intrigue into them
But I''m a nerd, so I''m gonna sacrifice it, screw it!
I wanna talk about books

[Talks to Slava KPSS]
– You can take a nap in meanwhile
– Gonna humiliate me now, for Jacques Genet?
– Nah, nah, nah

There''s this great book called The Hero with a Thousand Faces
I bet it''s gonna sell well now
I read it back in Kiev this crazy spring
When I was deep in the solitude
The tongue left me, I was stuck
You don''t know what it is
Everyone was wondering: drinking or preparing a new release?
Meanwhile I was there, just sitting on a balcony
(Those rhymes are so-so, right?
But whatever, they''re true.)
That book returned me back to life
I realized that I''m still alive
And the same book inspired Lucas, back in the day, to write (Where''s Obi? Oh, there he is) Star Wars
The idea is simple: in all mythologies, in all religions, no matter how many
And in the base of any story there''s on motif:
Someone hears the voice from afar
He leaves the home alone
He takes the road out of the town
Goes straight into a forest full of nets
Finds some monsters on his way
He fights them, still alone
He''s not a hero yet, he''s afraid of everything
But he keeps going
Eventually, he finds the lair
It will be hard, but he''ll make it
He''ll kill the dragon, get back to home
But he won''t be the same person he left
He''ll sleep a bit, no doubt
And then will go out again
All the comic books are based on this
The TV shows, the layers of culture
The drug trips, the dystopias, the fairy tales, the fables, the sculptures, and the dreams
To the point that if you compare Egypt myths and Banditskiy Peterburg
You''ll the the path of one hero under the disguise of these two
The path of the hero, killing the monsters
Collecting the treasures, building pagan temples
He''s not a hero because he''s ripped and he''s a warrior
But because it can''t be any other way
I remember the first battles in Russia
People thought you had to throw thousands @%#$s at the opponent
Then they started the deconstruction
Everyone would take the enemy apart
But behind all this kitchen psychology
Lies the collective unconscious

[Slava KPSS replies]
Oh yeah?

And behind any, even everyday one
Demonstration of negativity between two different people
You can see the ancient motif, collision of archetypes
The heroes, the dragons, they''re still here
Even if the battle is in office between a stapler and a hole puncher
And the heroes are similar to the dragons, people mix them up, but wait
There''s a fundamental difference between two
The dragon doesn''t have his own way, doesn''t have his own idea, no ideology
His role is to be an enemy. He''s chilling in his lair, breathing the smoke with fire
Why doesn''t, for example, Joker have his own movie?
Batman has one, Catwoman, Batman and Robin, but not him
Why is there no game where you''re playing as a mushroom, jumping on Super Mario?
And if there was one, it would be a joke. Millions wouldn''t be playing it
You get it. My !#!$ysis is rather simple
Gnojnyj, you''re just one more level, but not the final boss
The hero isn''t afraid to say I have the flaws, I''m vulnerable
That''s why people will see themselves in him
They won''t see anything in you
You''re a snake, you''re afraid of me and yourself
The only chance you have is to joke away, while mocking
You''re a slippery bastard, can''t catch you
Except it''s not a feature, it''s a bug, man
(Speaking of a programmer)
Because sarcasm is a shell, an armor, scales
But where are you, tovarisch?
I spit with the open visor, friends
Therefore you will lose
Maybe it''s just the way it goes or the karma is just $#%!ty
But you only played the antagonist''s role
And that''s the tragedy of Slava Mashnov, Karelin, et cetera
You are not an anti-hero, you are not a hero even
Zero empathy towards you
And crowd won''t go after you
For them, you''re just another person to follow in Instagram
You have no path, you used mine
But forgot that mine was sincere
Battle rap, black humor, and grime: where''s Gnojnyj behind mockery and anonymity?
There''s none, or he disappeared
You copied everything, even my gesture
Mister postmodernist, you are a compost, but $#%!-ist
All there''s left for you is to be an MC on parties
(@%#! that, you don''t have to make noise for that)
Oh, and maybe someone has noticed it
But my rounds have no mat in them
"How''s that?", will ask me Gotham. "You''re the author of that one quote."
It''s simple: I''m battling against a shell-shocked, really bland rat
While obscene language is the crowning jewel of the great Russian language
Okay?
And let''s say that today, perhaps, you will even defeat me

[Slava KPSS replies]
I will

I will get back to touring
You will get back to trolling me

[Slava KPSS replies]
Yep. That''s fantastic!
Let''s applaud the poet!

One hour caliphs, leaders for a moment
Look, ready to conquer the Olympus, while bragging about it
What?
My cake with candles is lit afar
I''m so old that "Black Star" for me is Talib Kweli and Mos Def

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Yeaaah, that''s good stuff

And some voice is whispering:
"Drop this rap $#%!
Keep your trail clean
Before you end up degrading like brostep"
But the bunch of faces are blinded by the opposite light
Screeching, tears, underwear, we are a boy band
And you? You''re momma''s armchair critic
Listen, EeOneGuy
As Stalin once said:
"If you''re criticizing something, then suggest something else!"
You gonna act like a fool, act recklessly
Doesn''t matter, you''re still in my rap coordinate system
If, one day, you come up with a different style
Because it''s shameful to live by someone else''s paradigm when you''re 27
Then you will be on your own way, you''ll be the protagonist of the narrative
Until then, you''re what an ass came up with
Slava, Slava, you''re jaunty and sweet
But take my organ out of your throat
You were a rather tall punching bag
I used to prepare myself for the battle with Dizaster!
Time!

[Voice from the crowd]
Slava, you''re just a marionette!

[Round 3: Slava KPSS]
You''re so @%#!ing narcissistic, bro. "I''m grime!"
But if you google "grime", you''ll see my video from Slovo
That''s how you promote grime those four long years
You''re angry at me, because I call my bull$#%! "grime"?
You''re so dumb, you don''t even get the joke, moron
I stole the dearest from you, like it''s kidnapping
Because of me, grime in Russia is now rap battles with fast flow

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Is that your opinion?

Think I do this out of pity or because I wanna become famous?
I''m just laughing at you, you @%#!ing bald female midget
And I''m okay with a status of Vkontakte-artist
While you don''t get it, like a postmodernist any money in a pawnbroker''s shop
You migrated to Russia, but your hair are in panic
Ran away to Europe, like Syrian refugees
What''s next on the menu? Let''s talk about your Aryan schnoz
If it decides to leave, you know, like in Gogol''s story
It will go straight to Israel, to get the dough
Since your nostril looks like the cave Christ was born in
@%#!, only you can refrain from battling for a year
Tatu dedicated their "Malchik Gay" to you
I need The Easy Way to Stop Battling, since I @%#! a bunch of battlers like you every day
There''s a red dwarf in front of me, like I see Betelgeuse in the telescope
Hail you down with a bunch of punchlines, call it flow Mayweather
Bodybag, since I play battle rap frequently
My number of frags is off the charts, like I''m playing laser tag
@%#! everybody!
Keep talking about nihilism, but you can tell a denier since he''s shining from the inside out
"@%#! mainstream!"... shouted this counterculturist during his battle against Dunya
Now, using myself as an example, he explained why this way leads nowhere
"It''s miserable and awful, but why do I need this boiling $#%!?
I declined even Evening Urgant''s offer!"
Declined, yeah? You''re a Jew, remember?
Here you''re so true, but behind the curtain...
You declined the commercial offers to get all the fattest ones!

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Real talk, real talk
What about you, though?

He went to Urgant, after all, but was outrageously... neat there
Wore a shirt with a dumb print
Damn, you showed them corporate pigs!
Take that, @%#!ing cultural terror! Weren''t ready?
If they invite him to Dom-2, he''ll wear socks with sandals
@%#! off with your Showroom, stick your stock market data up your ass
I roll you into a shawarma and shove it in Khovan''s throat!
Enough!
You meshed so well with the image of the saint buffoon, you''ll feel a mild pain when I start tearing it off, along with the flesh
"My work with Reebok is to create something new and not grab the cash from the fans"
They take some old sneakers, put the Oxxxy logo on them, and then double the price!
@%#!, that''s what you were fighting for?
Well, you''re out of luck
You were a hungry MC, ate others, and became spoiled
It''s really pitiful
To see a lonely and sad 30-years old man who drags a fangirl into his dressing room
@%#! it, I dedicate this to all the girls:

You like the Mayor''s song so much
Don''t know about postmodern rap
You go wild when you hear "Devochka-Pizdets" and go on Oxxxy''s concert
But remember: even the prince can be a scumbag
And if he sees a princess in you, he''s like a dragon
Can catch you and @%#! you in the cave!
Yeah, in your very own little cave
So what about the battle with Schokk?
"He was like a brother to me, I''ll never make a show out of it!"
Well, that''s honorable, to not $#%! on those you were together with
But then you quarrelled with LSP and acted like Buzova at Lobnoe mesto
You released an hour-long video to throw $#%! at your former artist
Therefore that''s exactly what your current artists can expect to happen later
Makes sense, right?
And at the end he said, "If we have to, we can solve this the other ways. It''s not 2013, we''re different now!"
Really? Are you proud that you''re so brutal now you can beat LSP up?
Maybe you''ll @%#!ing kick Dzharakhov in his face too?
Or will leak a %!@ tape to fans?
God, no trans is trying so @%#!ing hard to look masculine
Pretending to be a cowboy? Stop this $#%!
Only in Brokeback Mountain you could be the Red-ass Chief
You''re spitting rhymes, you aren''t robbing a bank
If you see a bunch of rods around you, then you''re walking in a park
You forgot what the hatred is
In a beef, you''re like a disabled person in a wheelchair
"The scum assumed my kindness was a weakness". @%#!, that sounds like it''s from the Twitter of some %$#@@ from the block!
Called Sasha a toastmaster, meanwhile you performed your verse from the battle on Serebro''s corporate party
A toastmaster!
True story!

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
That was not a corporate party. I can prove it easily

More contests await! Turn off the lights
Whoever loses goes to Butyrka prison? Sure
After that situation with Chechnya, I''m the best at throwing a pencil into a bottle!
And you still live off that pretentious culture creator''s $#%!, huh?
No self-irony, no mockery
"Porchy, Akela has missed!", when you''re $@#%ing past urinal
You narcissistic moron, that''s not theatrical stage for you
But you spent more time in front of The Mirror than Andrei Tarkovsky
All those songs that are only about yourself
How you, alone, with a bag of polonium, for 6 years straight
"Didn''t try to appeal to those who despised you at first"?
Dubious $#%!
Act in Zhigan''s film? That''s a really eloquent symptom
Apparently it''s the only person in the world who has both Down and Stockholm syndromes!
Like general Vlasov, you are a piece of $#%! and a traitor
When you received the news from Berlin, you changed your side
Threw your friend away faster than the gangster his shawarma
I wouldn''t let you to have my back, like you''re a drunken tattoo master

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
You were fifteen

And all for the stadiums and the loud crowds?
Olimpiyskiy will be a great coffin for an ego of your size
And when I think, "Stop! That can''t be it! Oxxxymiron is way smarter than that"
I remember that you like Lyokha Med
That you praise Mozee Montana and dream about performing in Olimpiyskiy

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Yeah. Things, things

@%#!, you''re as picky about your tastes as a young %$#@@ at a house party!
How angry he was when he couldn''t sign Bumble Beezy
He chose... "Punchlines and Rhymes"
Your booking has a problem, Beezy is the Russian Lil Peep
But MCs aren''t memes for you to steal them from "RiP"
@%#!, wanna earn money with booking? It''s easier to earn money with Booker
Your shots are flat like it''s a platformer shooter game
Rem Digga was rhyming about Donbass, people went into trenches after him
And the only person who did anything after you is Urgant, who drew a @%#$ on his neck

[Slava KPSS shouts at the crowd cheering him]
Shush! Shush! Shush!

You didn''t live near the verbal ore in a mine
But you''re so @%#!ing pretentious, like you were in the same school with Putin
"Only forward! Only the progress!"
But what kind of progress? Towards the Western sound?
Any newbie can make beats like yours nowadays
Towards quality? Well, we heard your tracks
You even admitted yourself they were mixed in a slapdash manner
So, what''s up, stadium rapper? Where are you going?
You don''t cut the window to the West, you''re the Rat-catcher of Hamelin
You bring everyone to the bottom along with you
Like all of your new school. I''ve heard plenty of this stuff
If you wanna do like them, just be a McDonald''s franchisee
If there is good kid, m.A.A.d city already, why the @%#! do I need Gorgorod in my player?
Solving creativity challenges someone has already solved
Is like reusing a teabag
Yeah, you can do it, but it''s not the same. Shameful stuff for poor rappers
Who lack any new ideas. You are not Kendrick Lamar in Russia
In your whole career there was nothing except for @%#!ing self-reflection
"Me, me, me", all the stuff you recorded is about your own figure
You talk so @%#!ing much about culture, but have you even tried giving it a careful thought?
No, you have not. Even in our $#%!ty song about vape we''ve said way more
All your rap is about nothing, because it''s about Oxxxy

So, @%#! you and @%#! Versus, with its submissive crowd!
I would rather die a @%#!ing noname than become famous and end up being like you!

[Slava KPSS asks Oxxxymiron]
– Would you let me drink your water?
– Nah. I can give the whole bottle to you, though
– Thanks
– Won''t drink from the same bottle as you

It was never going to be the project we hoped for—after all, the mixtape came together in just 6 days. That’s the kind of pace at which Future regularly operates. Drake? Not so much: “It''s tough to see someone do four, five songs in one night and not try to match it.” The result was a hit-and-run snapshot of strip-club rap at its absolute pinnacle. The unrestrained joy of "Jumpman" juxtaposed with the lights-on sadness of "Plastic Bag" doesn’t get any more Magic City. Neither artist was in album mode, but the temptation to label WATTBA as a throwaway project would be unwise. The substance lies in the process, and the result is more enjoyable than 95 percent of music released in 2015. That''s really all that matters in the end. — Theonlydjorkaeff18. Meek Mill - Dreams Worth More Than Money
Meek Mill’s sophomore album came with an abundance of prepackaged drama and anticipation. Three years after his debut album and subsequent incarceration, Meek finally delivered a record ordained and ready for the streets he roamed as a nappy-braided youngin. From symphonic tracks like “Lord Knows” with Tory Lanez, to flamboyant whip bangers like “Jump Out The Face” and "R.I.C.O." assisted by Drake — Dreams Worth More Than Money showcases Meek''s versatility and storytelling repertoire. His alliance with Nicki Minaj adds a touch of love to a gangsta''s paradise, the self-proclaimed Queen of Rap appearing on “All Eyes On You” and “Bad For You.” This record showed listeners that with the right combination of braggadocio, drama, and emotional depth, even a street album can reach the ears and minds of the world. — Slickk17. Logic - The Incredible True Story

Logic’s sophomore album is a sci-fi epic. Semi-frequent interludes dubbed "scenes" are interwoven throughout the album''s hour-long runtime, separating some of Logic’s best songs to date. The concept piece, composed during a one-night writing session, chronicles the journey of two astronauts looking for a hospitable planet dubbed "Paradise." While on their journey, the pair passes the time by listening to Logic’s The Incredible True Story in the year 2115. Behind the 18 tracks stand 9 producers, not including Logic who makes 10, and a sole feature verse from Logic''s long-time friend and RattPack member Big Lenbo on fan favorite “Young Jesus.” With the project''s stellar production and lyrical content, it’s easy to see why he achieved his goal of 100,000 units sold in the first week. "This is the album that changed everything." — Skhills16. Mac Miller - GO:OD AM
GO:OD AM is a departure from the sad, drugged-out Mac we were used to. He felt motivated and confident from the get-go and it''s clear Miller wanted this album to reflect that change.  The Mac from K.I.D.S joined forces with the introspective nature of Watching Movies With The Sound Off, finding balance on the LP. The result: his strongest project to date. The MC from Pittsburgh held his own on every song, with clever punchlines like: “You put the ho in honest baby, so complicated” on the standout “100 Grandkids”. He often outshines guests like Ab-Soul, Little Dragon, Miguel, and Chief Keef over production by Tyler the Creator, DJ Dahi, and ID Labs. GO:OD AM is another solid display from Miller. — YahwehSolomon15. Rae Sremmurd - SremmlifeIn time when a full-time job seems like 60 hours a week, stepping back and having fun is underrated. That’s where Rae Sremmurd’s debut album SremmLife comes in. While the duo don’t tackle social issues like Kendrick Lamar or have the intricacies of Pusha T, they make hit records. Even Push admitted their brilliance: “They make songs that I can’t” he acknowledged on Hot 97. And he’s right. Slim Jxmmy and Swae Lee are hip hop’s new dynamic duo, full of chemistry and swag, strutting their stuff over Mike WiLL Made-It bangers. In a project filled with lead singles, the stars aligned with three charting on the Billboard Top 100 and two, “No Flex Zone” and “No Type” became instant hits. Hit up your friends, crack open some bottles and let Rae Sremmurd be the soundtrack to your holiday season. — MvdS14. Young Thug - Barter 6Just when you thought Kanye West was the most polarizing artist in popular culture, along came Young Thug in 2013. Though many disregard Thugger as a weird and wacky singer, by Thug standards, Barter 6 is articulate and clear. Song structure takes center stage as his melodic voice dances over Wheezy & London on Da Track production. Accompanied by Cash Money boss Birdman on the standout “Constantly Hating,"  Thugger slows things down from his usual all-over the place delivery, making sure his haters understand every single word. Solo highlights include “Check” and “Halftime,” with the latter featuring several flow changes as Thugger switches between rapping and singing effortlessly. Despite the initial Tha Carter VI controversy, Thugger delivered an exciting preview to his proper full length debut Hi-Tunes slated for a 2016 release. — Michael Heal13. Jay Rock - 90059The long-awaited follow up to Jay Rock’s 2011’s Follow Me Home finally arrived this year, and it didn’t disappoint. The ''90s inspired, action-packed album fits 11 blockbuster tracks into 45 minutes and one zip code. 90059''s street philosophy is evident on tracks like “Gumbo” and “Money Trees Deuce,” while Rock’s TDE brethren join him under the Black Hippy moniker on posse cut “Vice City.” Lyrics and perspective are Jay’s fortes and he brings both in abundance on this record. The intro track, “Necessary” paints a vivid picture:The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill
When you live in America, either kill or be killed— Vuk Aleksic12. Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment - SurfDespite hopes this would be a solo Chance The Rapper project, The Social Experiment''s Donnie Trumpet took the helm on the collaborative Surf. This paid dividends—the free album was downloaded 618,000 times via iTunes in its first week. Sporting a star-studded tracklist filled with high-profile names like Big Sean, J. Cole, Erykah Badu and Busta Rhymes, highlights include “Sunday Candy," an ode to Chance’s grandmother, as well “Wanna Be Cool," a reminder that the coolest thing you can ever be is yourself. The band, comprised of Donnie, Chance, Peter Cottontale, Greg Landfair Jr. and Nate Fox, delivered a unique, genre-bending album that we can’t get enough of. — MvdS11. Game - Documentary 2.5It can be tough pinpointing The Game''s personality on any one of his albums. His voice is often lost among the bevy of top-class talent at his disposal and while the Documentary 2 & 2.5 promised a similar outcome, with close to 20 top-drawer collaborators, Game''s concept and vision shines through on the second disc. One of his strongest ever vocal performance propels "From Adam" to another dimension, and his constant to-and-fro between gangland harmonizer and Blood soldier is a sight to behold. A shuddering verse on "Gang Bang Anyway" exposes the inner torment of a ghetto truth others are desperately afraid to touch. But Game has never dealt in the currency of shame, and this record is a stark reminder why his voice will remain important in hip-hop. — Theonlydjorkaeff10. Earl Sweatshirt - I Don''t Like #$!%, I Don''t Go OutsideI Don''t Like #$!%, I Don''t Go Outside clocks in at 29 minutes, just enough time for Earl Sweatshirt to retreat into the depths of his mind and unleash an LP packed full of raw lyricism: “I don''t act hard, I''m a hard act to follow, $@@$# / Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen" he raps on standout “Grief." His accession in the rap game is a common theme throughout the album, while other topics range from a break-up to outgrowing his parental home. With the exception of "Off Top," Earl produced the whole album (as moniker randomblackdude) and only four rappers are featured artists. His mood changes may be swift, but Earl''s self-realization and unbarred honesty deserve to be praised. — Sem Groeneweg9. Dr. Dre - Compton
Compton was unexpected. While we were all sitting around joking that Dre will never drop an album again after the decade-plus wait for Detox, the Doctor had been busy in the lab. Dre gave us a soundtrack, encapsulating a cinematic experience  perfectly timed with the release of the Straight Outta Compton film. You can hear it, Dre was inspired.

He drew from a plethora of experiences to meticulously craft the LP. The frightening “Deep Water” serves as a metaphor depicting Compton as a giant shark tank, while the soulful, melodic, deep-cut “Animals” sees Anderson .Paak invite the listener sympathize with his message. Dre spared no expense with this album, assembling a crew of all-stars and rookies. Not only did he create an album that serves as an epic finale to his career, but also mapped out a legacy for the younger generation to follow. — Dr. Strange8. Joey Bada$$ - B4.DA.$$Always praised for his nostalgic aesthetic, Joey Bada$$ delivered another updated boom-bap project with B4.DA.$$. While the LP hasn''t made a bigger impact than 1999, Joey surprised fans with more personal lyrics and a great ear for beats. Big time producers like DJ Premier, Statik Selektah  and Hit-Boy blessed the young MC with dope drum breaks to spit over. Credit is due to someone who can ascend their passion. So while hip hop’s chosen one hasn''t reached his full potential yet, B4.Da.$$ is a step in the right direction. — Sem Groeneweg7. Travis Scott - Rodeo

Despite the name of his 2014 prequel/mixtape Days Before Rodeo, Travi$ Scott’s debut album arrived almost a year later. The enigmatic Scott emerged from the blogosphere in 2012 with almost industry plant level hype as a signee to both T.I’s Grand Hustle and Kanye West’s G.O.O.D Music. Over the next three years, Scott’s various features, production credits, and mixtapes would shape the sound of Rodeo. This sound was crafted with the help of fellow Houstonian Mike Dean and this year''s Most Valuable Producer Metro Boomin to create a Mo City Yeezus. Dark, menacing synths and slab-rattling 808s on the opening track “Pornography” set the tone for the album as Travis acts as a conduit, morphing potentially overshadowing features from Migos, The Weeknd, Justin Bieber and others into songs that make up an album that is uniquely La Flame. — BasedGator6. Future - DS2

On his third studio album, Future’s hallmark repetitive, pounding sound was replaced by agile and varied raps over sweeping, addictive productions. It both silenced skeptics and galvanized Future’s fanbase, cementing his position at the center of the rap game and the top of the charts. From trap bangers like “Where Ya At” and “Blow a Bag” to the emotional storytelling of “Kno the Meaning” and half-lidded-gem “The Percocet & Stripper Joint,” there’s a ton of variety, but no dull moments. Lead single and highlight “$@!% Up Some Commas” doesn’t even show up until track 18 on the deluxe edition, but you don’t find yourself waiting for it to arrive.

A lot of the talk around Future this year focused on his impressive output: four full-length projects, two of which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. The fact is, Future’s been flooding the market for most of his career: He put out the same number of projects (including the original Dirty Sprite) in 2011. The difference this year was that the music demanded our undivided attention, and no project drove this point home as much as DS2, the shiniest purple diamond in the already-jewel-encrusted crown of 2015’s #futurehive. — Ezra Glenn5. Drake - If You''re Reading This it''s Too Late
Originally billed as a DJ Drama, mixtape, If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late became Drake’s reported escape from Cash Money Records. The 17-track “mixtape” proved to the world Drake is truly running this rap #$!%. With no prior announcement, the record managed to sell 495,000 copies — the best first week for a rap album in 2015. Executive produced by Drake, 40, and Boi-1da, Drizzy churned out hit after hit. Before anyone knew it, the whole project was on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart. From call-outs to his enemies on “Energy” to a long-awaited “5AM In Toronto,” sequel, aptly titled “6PM In New York,” Drake solidified his place as a hegemon in the rap state. Negative energy may have tried to take Drake down, but the 6 God was too busy running through the six with his woes in 2015. — Slickk4. Vince Staples - Summertime ''06Summer of 2006, the beginning of the end of everything I thought I knew. Youth was stolen from my city that Summer and I’m left alone to tell the story. —  Vince StaplesSummertime ‘06 is a candid, vivid depiction of life in the streets. In just under an hour, Vince Staples immerses the listener in his world. From the brash and unapologetic “Norf Norf” to the trap-inspired “Señorita” and the hopeful closer “Like It Is,” Staples delivers a range of cuts unlike most debut albums. Not only is he ambitious with sound, Vince is ambitious in content, releasing a double-disc project. Veteran super producer No I.D served as executive producer with appearances by Clams Casino and DJ Dahi. Summertime ’06 is a fantastic debut LP, highlighting how far he''s come as an artist and more importantly, showcasing his potential to go ever further. — YahwehSolomon3. A$AP Rocky - At.Long.Last.A$AP

Although titled in the same breath, At.Long.Last.A$AP was a departure from the sound that made A$AP Rocky famous. With no Clams Casino behind the boards or spoon-fed hits like “$@!%in’ Problems,” Rocky delivered a sonic platter of dark, psychedelia-infused joints. Harlem''s own found solace in drugs after the passing of longtime friend and collaborator A$AP Yams, moving to London where he recorded the majority of the LP with newfound friend Joe Fox. Standout features include underground rapper Bones on the marauding “C%#!@ St.” and Kanye West on the soulful “Jukebox Joints.” With impeccable production and little filler, A.L.L.A is still on repeat, six months after its release. — Michael Heal2. Lupe Fiasco - Lupe Fiasco - Tetsuo and YouthWhile Lupe Fiasco delivered his fifth studio album Tetsuo and Youth in January, the LP remains one of the best rap albums of 2015. Super Lupe delivered a seasonal concept; “Summer” to “Fall,” followed by “Winter” and “Spring.” These “palate cleansers” serve as interludes between lush production and razor-sharp lyrics. From Lupe’s eight-minute epic intro track, “Mural” to Terrace Martin’s saxophone solo on “Body of Work” and Billy Blue’s deep gruff on “Chopper,” T&Y is as expansive in sound as it is lyrically deep. The Chi-Town MC even suggested listening to the LP backwards. Talk about Genius. Only Lupe could pull off something so intricate. — Michael Heal1. Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly
Kendrick Lamar''s To Pimp A Butterfly follows his rise to fame and subsequent survivor''s guilt after the release of good kid, m.A.A.d city.  K. Dot finds himself struggling through a war waging within his psyche, challenged by the dichotomy of his poignant insecurities and exceptional collectedness. Quite often, he finds himself entrapped in a self-constructed mausoleum—and only here, does he begin to realize his own shortcomings—prompting self-reconciliation and the determination to apply what he’s learnt to the rest of his community.  The standout “u” delivers raw, visceral anger, while its counterpart “i” promotes self-love and inner strength. Meanwhile, “Alright” serves humanity, inspiring those fighting against social injustices. To Pimp A Butterfly wasn''t just the album we wanted—it''s the album we needed. — Eon2323Check out the 50 Best Rap Songs of 2015 here.19Embed', 1, N'None', 0, 100001, NULL, 100000, NULL, N'2024-03-21 00:00:00')
