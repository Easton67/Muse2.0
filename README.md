# Muse
## Technologies used
TSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, Visio, Adobe XD, Github
## Project Description
Muse is a music-sharing multi-user data-driven application, built off of the C# .NET framework with n-tier architecture. Users will be able to play other user's uploaded songs, create custom public profiles to share with friends and curate their own playlists. This project will be created throughout 8 weeks and 4 sprints.
## Scope of Work
### Week 1 & 2: Documentation and planning
1. Creating a Feature list with both minimal viable product and desirable features. 
2. Making extensive UIs within Adobe XD
3. Creating the Data Dictionary
4. Creating the ER Diagram
5. Creating the User Stories
### Week 3 & 4: Project Setup and Coding
1. Building the SQL Script
2. Creating the .BAT file to run the database
3. Initial Setup with N-Tier Architecture
4. Coding, testing using the AAA methodology, and debugging feature by feature
### Week 5 & 6: Continuing Code
1. Continue building out each feature
2. Making sure that all tests needed are here
### Week 7 & 8: Final TouchUps
1. Look over all code to ensure neatness and continuity with styling
2. Creating comments where needed
3. Making sure all names are understandable to read
4. Fixes where needed in the UI

Using these sprints, and the AGILE style of development, I plan to create the best project I possibly can for my users.
